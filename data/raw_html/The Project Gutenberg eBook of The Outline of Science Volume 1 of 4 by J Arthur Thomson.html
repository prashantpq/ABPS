 <h2>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h2>

 <p class="center">By Professor J. Arthur Thomson</p>

 <p>Was it not the great philosopher and mathematician Leibnitz who said that
 the more knowledge advances the more it becomes possible to condense it into
 little books? Now this &quot;Outline of Science&quot; is certainly not a
 little book, and yet it illustrates part of the meaning of Leibnitz&#39;s
 wise saying. For here within reasonable compass there is a library of little
 books&mdash;an outline of many sciences.</p>

 <p>It will be profitable to the student in proportion to the discrimination
 with which it is used. For it is not in the least meant to be of the nature
 of an Encyclopædia, giving condensed and comprehensive articles with a big
 full stop at the end of each. Nor is it a collection of &quot;primers,&quot;
 beginning at the very beginning of each subject and working methodically
 onwards. That is not the idea.</p>

 <p>What then is the aim of this book? It is to give the intelligent
 student-citizen, otherwise called &quot;the man in the street,&quot; a bunch
 of intellectual keys by which to open doors which have been hitherto shut to
 him, partly because he got no glimpse of the treasures behind the doors, and
 partly because the portals were made forbidding by an unnecessary display of
 technicalities. Laying aside conventional modes of treatment and seeking
 rather to open up the subject as one might on a walk with a friend, the work
 offers the student what might be called informal introductions to the various
 departments of knowledge. To put it in another way, the articles are meant to
 be clues which the reader may follow till he has left his starting point very
 far behind. Perhaps when he has gone far on his own he will not be ungrateful
 to the simple book of &quot;instructions to travellers&quot; which
 this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
 &quot;Outline of Science&quot; is intended to be. The simple
 &quot;bibliographies&quot; appended to the various articles will be enough to
 indicate &quot;first books.&quot; Each article is meant to be an invitation
 to an intellectual adventure, and the short lists of books are merely
 finger-posts for the beginning of the journey.</p>

 <p>We confess to being greatly encouraged by the reception that has been
 given to the English serial issue of &quot;The Outline of Science.&quot; It
 has been very hearty&mdash;we might almost say enthusiastic. For we agree
 with Professor John Dewey, that &quot;the future of our civilisation depends
 upon the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of
 mind.&quot; And we hope that this is what &quot;The Outline of Science&quot;
 makes for. Information is all to the good; interesting information is better
 still; but best of all is the education of the scientific habit of mind.
 Another modern philosopher, Professor L. T. Hobhouse, has declared that the
 evolutionist&#39;s mundane goal is &quot;the mastery by the human mind of the
 conditions, internal as well as external, of its life and growth.&quot; Under
 the influence of this conviction &quot;The Outline of Science&quot; has been
 written. For life is not for science, but science for life. And even more
 than science, to our way of thinking, is the individual development of the
 scientific way of looking at things. Science is our legacy; we must use it if
 it is to be our very own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id=

 <h1>The Outline of Science</h1>
 <hr />

 <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

 <p>There is abundant evidence of a widened and deepened interest in modern
 science. How could it be otherwise when we think of the magnitude and the
 eventfulness of recent advances?</p>

 <p>But the interest of the general public would be even greater than it is if
 the makers of new knowledge were more willing to expound their discoveries in
 ways that could be &quot;understanded of the people.&quot; No one objects
 very much to technicalities in a game or on board a yacht, and they are
 clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description. It is
 certain, however, that they can be reduced to a minimum without sacrificing
 accuracy, when the object in view is to explain &quot;the gist of the
 matter.&quot; So this <span class="smcap">Outline of Science</span> is meant
 for the general reader, who lacks both time and opportunity for special
 study, and yet would take an intelligent interest in the progress of science
 which is making the world always new.</p>

 <p>The story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which Man may well
 be proud. Science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises the
 atom; foretells the date of the comet&#39;s return and predicts the kinds of
 chickens that will hatch from a dozen eggs; discovers the laws of the wind
 that bloweth where it listeth and reduces to order the disorder of disease.
 Science is always setting forth on Columbus voyages, discovering new worlds
 and conquering them by understanding. For Knowledge means Foresight and
 Foresight means Power.</p>

 <p>The idea of Evolution has influenced all the sciences, forcing us to think
 of <i>everything</i> as with a history behind it, for we have travelled far
 since Darwin&#39;s day. The solar system, the earth, the mountain ranges, and
 the great deeps, the rocks and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id=
 "Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> crystals, the plants and animals, man himself and
 his social institutions&mdash;all must be seen as the outcome of a long
 process of Becoming. There are some eighty-odd chemical elements on the earth
 to-day, and it is now much more than a suggestion that these are the outcome
 of an inorganic evolution, element giving rise to element, going back and
 back to some primeval stuff, from which they were all originally derived,
 infinitely long ago. No idea has been so powerful a tool in the fashioning of
 New Knowledge as this simple but profound idea of Evolution, that the present
 is the child of the past and the parent of the future. And with the picture
 of a continuity of evolution from nebula to social systems comes a promise of
 an increasing control&mdash;a promise that Man will become not only a more
 accurate student, but a more complete master of his world.</p>

 <p>It is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to be
 more vital than before. Everywhere there has been a passage from the static
 to the dynamic. Thus the new revelations of the constitution of matter, which
 we owe to the discoveries of men like Professor Sir J. J. Thomson, Professor
 Sir Ernest Rutherford, and Professor Frederick Soddy, have shown the very
 dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore unimagined. Such phrases
 as &quot;dead&quot; matter and &quot;inert&quot; matter have gone by the
 board.</p>

 <p>The new theory of the atom amounts almost to a new conception of the
 universe. It bids fair to reveal to us many of nature&#39;s hidden secrets.
 The atom is no longer the indivisible particle of matter it was once
 understood to be. We know now that there is an atom within the
 atom&mdash;that what we thought was elementary can be dissociated and broken
 up. The present-day theories of the atom and the constitution of matter are
 the outcome of the comparatively recent discovery of such things as radium,
 the X-rays, and the wonderful revelations of such instruments as the
 spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments.</p>

 <p>The advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what
 before was hidden or only dimly guessed at. It has given us a new conception
 of the framework of the universe. We are beginning to know and realise of
 what matter is made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg
 5]</a></span> and what electric phenomena mean. We can glimpse the vast
 stores of energy locked up in matter. The new knowledge has much to tell us
 about the origin and phenomena, not only of our own planet, but other
 planets, of the stars, and the sun. New light is thrown on the source of the
 sun&#39;s heat; we can make more than guesses as to its probable age. The
 great question to-day is: is there <i>one</i> primordial substance from which
 all the varying forms of matter have been evolved?</p>

 <p>But the discovery of electrons is only one of the revolutionary changes
 which give modern science an entrancing interest.</p>

 <p>As in chemistry and physics, so in the science of living creatures there
 have been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect. A good
 instance is afforded by the discovery of the &quot;hormones,&quot; or
 chemical messengers, which are produced by ductless glands, such as the
 thyroid, the supra-renal, and the pituitary, and are distributed throughout
 the body by the blood. The work of physiologists like Professor Starling and
 Professor Bayliss has shown that these chemical messengers regulate what may
 be called the &quot;pace&quot; of the body, and bring about that regulated
 harmony and smoothness of working which we know as health. It is not too much
 to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of physiology.
 Our knowledge of the human body far surpasses that of the past
 generation.</p>

 <p>The persistent patience of microscopists and technical improvements like
 the &quot;ultramicroscope&quot; have greatly increased our knowledge of the
 invisible world of life. To the bacteria of a past generation have been added
 a multitude of microscopic <i>animal</i> microbes, such as that which causes
 Sleeping Sickness. The life-histories and the weird ways of many important
 parasites have been unravelled; and here again knowledge means mastery. To a
 degree which has almost surpassed expectations there has been a revelation of
 the intricacy of the stones and mortar of the house of life, and the
 microscopic study of germ-cells has wonderfully supplemented the epoch-making
 experimental study of heredity which began with Mendel. It goes without
 saying that no one can call himself educated who does not understand the
 central and simple ideas of Mendelism and other new departures in
 biology.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg
 6]</a></span></p>

 <p>The procession of life through the ages and the factors in the sublime
 movement; the peopling of the earth by plants and animals and the linking of
 life to life in subtle inter-relations, such as those between flowers and
 their insect-visitors; the life-histories of individual types and the
 extraordinary results of the new inquiry called &quot;experimental
 embryology&quot;&mdash;these also are among the subjects with which this
 <span class="smcap">Outline</span> will deal.</p>

 <p>The behaviour of animals is another fascinating study, leading to a
 provisional picture of the dawn of mind. Indeed, no branch of science
 surpasses in interest that which deals with the ways and habits&mdash;the
 truly wonderful devices, adaptations, and instincts&mdash;of insects, birds,
 and mammals. We no longer deny a degree of intelligence to some members of
 the animal world&mdash;even the line between intelligence and reason is
 sometimes difficult to find.</p>

 <p>Fresh contacts between physiology and the study of man&#39;s mental life;
 precise studies of the ways of children and wild peoples; and new methods
 like those of the psycho-analyst must also receive the attention they
 deserve, for they are giving us a &quot;New Psychology&quot; and the claims
 of psychical research must also be recognised by the open-minded.</p>

 <p>The general aim of the <span class="smcap">Outline</span> is to give the
 reader a clear and concise view of the essentials of present-day science, so
 that he may follow with intelligence the modern advance and share
 appreciatively in man&#39;s continued conquest of his kingdom.</p>

 <hr />

 <h3>THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE&mdash;THE SOLAR SYSTEM</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <p>The story of the triumphs of modern science naturally opens with
 Astronomy. The picture of the Universe which the astronomer offers to us is
 imperfect; the lines he traces are often faint and uncertain. There are many
 problems which have been solved, there are just as many about which there is
 doubt, and notwithstanding our great increase in knowledge, there remain just
 as many which are entirely unsolved.</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>The problem of the structure and duration of the universe [said the great
  astronomer Simon Newcomb] is the most far-reaching with which the mind has
  to deal. Its solution may be regarded as the ultimate object of stellar
  astronomy, the possibility of reaching which has occupied the minds of
  thinkers since the beginning of civilisation. Before our time the problem
  could be considered only from the imaginative or the speculative point of
  view. Although we can to-day attack it to a limited extent by scientific
  methods, it must be admitted that we have scarcely taken more than the first
  step toward the actual solution.... What is the duration of the universe in
  time? Is it fitted to last for ever in its present form, or does it contain
  within itself the seeds of dissolution? Must it, in the course of time, in
  we know not how many millions of ages, be transformed into something very
  different from what it now is? This question is intimately associated with
  the question whether the stars form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10"
  id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> a system. If they do, we may suppose that
  system to be permanent in its general features; if not, we must look further
  for our conclusions.</p>
 </div>

 <h4 class="sect">The Heavenly Bodies</h4>

 <p>The heavenly bodies fall into two very distinct classes so far as their
 relation to our Earth is concerned; the one class, a very small one,
 comprises a sort of colony of which the Earth is a member. These bodies are
 called <i>planets</i>, or wanderers. There are eight of them, including the
 Earth, and they all circle round the sun. Their names, in the order of their
 distance from the sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
 Uranus, Neptune, and of these Mercury, the nearest to the sun, is rarely seen
 by the naked eye. Uranus is practically invisible, and Neptune quite so.
 These eight planets, together with the sun, constitute, as we have said, a
 sort of little colony; this colony is called the Solar System.</p>

 <p>The second class of heavenly bodies are those which lie <i>outside</i> the
 solar system. Every one of those glittering points we see on a starlit night
 is at an immensely greater distance from us than is any member of the Solar
 System. Yet the members of this little colony of ours, judged by terrestrial
 standards, are at enormous distances from one another. If a shell were shot
 in a straight line from one side of Neptune&#39;s orbit to the other it would
 take five hundred years to complete its journey. Yet this distance, the
 greatest in the Solar System as now known (excepting the far swing of some of
 the comets), is insignificant compared to the distances of the stars. One of
 the nearest stars to the earth that we know of is Alpha Centauri, estimated
 to be some twenty-five million millions of miles away. Sirius, the brightest
 star in the firmament, is double this distance from the earth.</p>

 <p>We must imagine the colony of planets to which we belong as a compact
 little family swimming in an immense void. At distances which would take our
 shell, not hundreds, but millions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id=
 "Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> of years to traverse, we reach the
 stars&mdash;or rather, a star, for the distances between stars are as great
 as the distance between the nearest of them and our Sun. The Earth, the
 planet on which we live, is a mighty globe bounded by a crust of rock many
 miles in thickness; the great volumes of water which we call our oceans lie
 in the deeper hollows of the crust. Above the surface an ocean of invisible
 gas, the atmosphere, rises to a height of about three hundred miles, getting
 thinner and thinner as it ascends.</p>

   <p>THE COMPARATIVE DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS</p>

   <p>(Drawn approximately to scale)</p>

   <p class="wide">The isolation of the Solar System is very great. On the
   above scale the <i>nearest</i> star (at a distance of 25 trillions of
   miles) would be over <i>one half mile</i> away. The hours, days, and years
   are the measures of time as we use them; that is: Jupiter&#39;s
   &quot;Day&quot; (one rotation of the planet) is made in ten of <i>our
   hours</i>; Mercury&#39;s &quot;Year&quot; (one revolution of the planet
   around the Sun) is eighty-eight of <i>our days</i>. Mercury&#39;s
   &quot;Day&quot; and &quot;Year&quot; are the same. This planet turns always
   the same side to the Sun.</p>

  <div class="caption">
   <p>THE COMPARATIVE SIZES OF THE SUN AND THE PLANETS</p>

   <p>(Drawn approximately to scale)</p>

   <p class="wide">On this scale the Sun would be 17½ inches in diameter; it
   is far greater than all the planets put together. Jupiter, in turn, is
   greater than all the other planets put together.</p>
  </div>
 </div>

 <p>Except when the winds rise to a high speed, we seem to live in a very
 tranquil world. At night, when the glare of the sun passes out of our
 atmosphere, the stars and planets seem to move across the heavens with a
 stately and solemn slowness. It was one of the first discoveries of modern
 astronomy that this movement is only apparent. The apparent creeping of the
 stars across the heavens at night is accounted for by the fact that the earth
 turns upon its axis once in every twenty-four hours. When we remember the
 size of the earth we see that this implies a prodigious speed.</p>

 <p>In addition to this the earth revolves round the sun at a speed of more
 than a thousand miles a minute. Its path round the sun, year in year out,
 measures about 580,000,000 miles. The earth is held closely to this path by
 the gravitational pull of the sun, which has a mass 333,432 times that of the
 earth. If at any moment the sun ceased to exert this pull the earth would
 instantly fly off into space straight in the direction in which it was moving
 at the time, that is to say, at a tangent. This tendency to fly off at a
 tangent is continuous. It is the balance between it and the sun&#39;s pull
 which keeps the earth to her almost circular orbit. In the same way the seven
 other planets are held to their orbits.</p>

 <p>Circling round the earth, in the same way as the earth circles round the
 sun, is our moon. Sometimes the moon passes directly between us and the sun,
 and cuts off the light from us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id=
 "Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> We then have a total or partial eclipse of the
 sun. At other times the earth passes directly between the sun and the moon,
 and causes an eclipse of the moon. The great ball of the earth naturally
 trails a mighty shadow across space, and the moon is &quot;eclipsed&quot;
 when it passes into this.</p>

 <p>The other seven planets, five of which have moons of their own, circle
 round the sun as the earth does. The sun&#39;s mass is immensely larger than
 that of all the planets put together, and all of them would be drawn into it
 and perish if they did not travel rapidly round it in gigantic orbits. So the
 eight planets, spinning round on their axes, follow their fixed paths round
 the sun. The planets are secondary bodies, but they are most important,
 because they are the only globes in which there can be life, as we know
 life.</p>

 <p>If we could be transported in some magical way to an immense distance in
 space above the sun, we should see our Solar System as it is drawn in the
 accompanying diagram (Fig. 1), except that the planets would be mere specks,
 faintly visible in the light which they receive from the sun. (This diagram
 is drawn approximately to scale.) If we moved still farther away, trillions
 of miles away, the planets would fade entirely out of view, and the sun would
 shrink into a point of fire, a star. And here you begin to realize the nature
 of the universe. <i>The sun is a star. The stars are suns.</i> Our sun looks
 big simply because of its comparative nearness to us. The universe is a
 stupendous collection of millions of stars or suns, many of which may have
 planetary families like ours.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Scale of the Universe</h4>

 <p>How many stars are there? A glance at a photograph of star-clouds will
 tell at once that it is quite impossible to count them. The fine photograph
 reproduced in Figure 2 represents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id=
 "Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> a very small patch of that pale-white belt, the
 Milky Way, which spans the sky at night. It is true that this is a
 particularly rich area of the Milky Way, but the entire belt of light has
 been resolved in this way into masses or clouds of stars. Astronomers have
 counted the stars in typical districts here and there, and from these partial
 counts we get some idea of the total number of stars. There are estimated to
 be between two and three thousand million stars.</p>

 <p>Yet these stars are separated by inconceivable distances from each other,
 and it is one of the greatest triumphs of modern astronomy to have mastered,
 so far, the scale of the universe. For several centuries astronomers have
 known the relative distances from each other of the sun and the planets. If
 they could discover the actual distance of any one planet from any other,
 they could at once tell all the distances within the Solar System.</p>

 <p>The sun is, on the latest measurements, at an average distance of
 92,830,000 miles from the earth, for as the orbit of the earth is not a true
 circle, this distance varies. This means that in six months from now the
 earth will be right at the opposite side of its path round the sun, or
 185,000,000 miles away from where it is now. Viewed or photographed from two
 positions so wide apart, the nearest stars show a tiny &quot;shift&quot;
 against the background of the most distant stars, and that is enough for the
 mathematician. He can calculate the distance of any star near enough to show
 this &quot;shift.&quot; We have found that the nearest star to the earth, a
 recently discovered star, is twenty-five trillion miles away. Only thirty
 stars are known to be within a hundred trillion miles of us.</p>

 <p>This way of measuring does not, however, take us very far away in the
 heavens. There are only a few hundred stars within five hundred trillion
 miles of the earth, and at that distance the &quot;shift&quot; of a star
 against the background (parallax, the astronomer calls it) is so minute that
 figures are very uncertain. At this point the astronomer takes up a new
 method. He learns the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg
 14]</a></span> different types of stars, and then he is able to deduce more
 or less accurately the distance of a star of a known type from its faintness.
 He, of course, has instruments for gauging their light. As a result of twenty
 years work in this field, it is now known that the more distant stars of the
 Milky Way are at least a hundred thousand trillion (100,000,000,000,000,000)
 miles away from the sun.</p>

 <p>Our sun is in a more or less central region of the universe, or a few
 hundred trillion miles from the actual centre. The remainder of the stars,
 which are all outside our Solar System, are spread out, apparently, in an
 enormous disc-like collection, so vast that even a ray of light, which
 travels at the rate of 186,000 miles a second, would take 50,000 years to
 travel from one end of it to the other. This, then is what we call our
 universe.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Are there other Universes?</h4>

 <p>Why do we say &quot;our universe&quot;? Why not <i>the</i> universe? It is
 now believed by many of our most distinguished astronomers that our colossal
 family of stars is only one of many universes. By a universe an astronomer
 means any collection of stars which are close enough to control each
 other&#39;s movements by gravitation; and it is clear that there might be
 many universes, in this sense, separated from each other by profound abysses
 of space. Probably there are.</p>

 <p>For a long time we have been familiar with certain strange objects in the
 heavens which are called &quot;spiral nebulæ&quot; (Fig 4). We shall see at a
 later stage what a nebula is, and we shall see that some astronomers regard
 these spiral nebulæ as worlds &quot;in the making.&quot; But some of the most
 eminent astronomers believe that they are separate
 universes&mdash;&quot;island-universes&quot; they call them&mdash;or great
 collections of millions of stars like our universe. There are certain
 peculiarities in the structure of the Milky Way which lead these astronomers
 to think that our universe may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id=
 "Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> a spiral nebula, and that the other spiral
 nebulæ are &quot;other universes.&quot;</p>

 <p>Vast as is the Solar System, then, it is excessively minute in comparison
 with the Stellar System, the universe of the Stars, which is on a scale far
 transcending anything the human mind can apprehend.</p>

 <h3>THE SOLAR SYSTEM</h3>

 <h3>THE SUN</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <p>But now let us turn to the Solar System, and consider the members of our
 own little colony.</p>

 <p>Within the Solar System there are a large number of problems that interest
 us. What is the size, mass, and distance of each of the planets? What
 satellites, like our Moon, do they possess? What are their temperatures? And
 those other, sporadic members of our system, comets and meteors, what are
 they? What are their movements? How do they originate? And the Sun itself,
 what is its composition, what is the source of its heat, how did it
 originate? Is it running down?</p>

 <p>These last questions introduce us to a branch of astronomy which is
 concerned with the physical constitution of the stars, a study which, not so
 very many years ago, may well have appeared inconceivable. But the
 spectroscope enables us to answer even these questions, and the answer opens
 up questions of yet greater interest. We find that the stars can be arranged
 in an order of development&mdash;that there are stars at all stages of their
 life-history. The main lines of the evolution of the stellar universe can be
 worked out. In the sun and stars we have furnaces with temperatures
 enormously high; it is in such conditions that substances are resolved into
 their simplest forms, and it is thus we are enabled to obtain a knowledge of
 the most primitive forms of matter. It is in this direction that the
 spectroscope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg
 16]</a></span> (which we shall refer to immediately) has helped us so much.
 It is to this wonderful instrument that we owe our knowledge of the
 composition of the sun and stars, as we shall see.</p>

  <p>&quot;That the spectroscope will detect the millionth of a milligram of
  matter, and on that account has discovered new elements, commands our
  admiration; but when we find in addition that it will detect the nature of
  forms of matter trillions of miles away, and moreover, that it will measure
  the velocities with which these forms of matter are moving with an absurdly
  small per cent. of possible error, we can easily acquiesce in the statement
  that it is the greatest instrument ever devised by the brain and hand of
  man.&quot;</p>

 <p>Such are some of the questions with which modern astronomy deals. To
 answer them requires the employment of instruments of almost incredible
 refinement and exactitude and also the full resources of mathematical genius.
 Whether astronomy be judged from the point of view of the phenomena studied,
 the vast masses, the immense distances, the æons of time, or whether it be
 judged as a monument of human ingenuity, patience, and the rarest type of
 genius, it is certainly one of the grandest, as it is also one of the oldest,
 of the sciences.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Solar System</h4>

 <p>In the Solar System we include all those bodies dependent on the sun which
 circulate round it at various distances, deriving their light and heat from
 the sun&mdash;the planets and their moons, certain comets and a multitude of
 meteors: in other words, all bodies whose movements in space are determined
 by the gravitational pull of the sun.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Sun</h4>

 <p>Thanks to our wonderful modern instruments and the ingenious methods used
 by astronomers, we have to-day a remarkable knowledge of the sun.</p>

 <p>Look at the figure of the sun in the frontispiece. The picture represents
 an eclipse of the sun; the dark body of the moon has screened the sun&#39;s
 shining disc and taken the glare out of our eyes; we see a silvery halo
 surrounding the great orb on every side. It is the sun&#39;s atmosphere, or
 &quot;crown&quot; (corona), stretching for millions of miles into space in
 the form of a soft silvery-looking light; probably much of its light is
 sunlight reflected from particles of dust, although the spectroscope shows an
 element in the corona that has not so far been detected anywhere else in the
 universe and which in consequence has been named Coronium.</p>

 <p>We next notice in the illustration that at the base of the halo there are
 red flames peeping out from the edges of the hidden disc. When one remembers
 that the sun is 866,000 miles in diameter, one hardly needs to be told that
 these flames are really gigantic. We shall see what they are presently.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Regions of the Sun</h4>

 <p>The astronomer has divided the sun into definite concentric regions or
 layers. These layers envelop the nucleus or central body of the sun somewhat
 as the atmosphere envelops our earth. It is through these vapour layers that
 the bright white body of the sun is seen. Of the innermost region, the heart
 or nucleus of the sun, we know almost nothing. The central body or nucleus is
 surrounded by a brilliantly luminous envelope or layer of vaporous matter
 which is what we see when we look at the sun and which the astronomer calls
 the photosphere.</p>

 <p>Above&mdash;that is, overlying&mdash;the photosphere there is a second
 layer of glowing gases, which is known as the reversing layer. This layer is
 cooler than the underlying photosphere; it forms a veil of smoke-like haze
 and is of from 500 to 1,000 miles in thickness.</p>

 <p>A third layer or envelope immediately lying over the last one is the
 region known as the chromosphere. The chromosphere extends from 5,000 to
 10,000 miles in thickness&mdash;a &quot;sea&quot; of red tumultuous surging
 fire. Chief among the glowing gases is the vapour of hydrogen. The intense
 white heat of the photosphere beneath shines through this layer, overpowering
 its brilliant redness. From the uppermost portion of the chromosphere great
 fiery tongues of glowing hydrogen and calcium vapour shoot out for many
 thousands of miles, driven outward by some prodigious expulsive force. It is
 these red &quot;prominences&quot; which are such a notable feature in the
 picture of the eclipse of the sun already referred to.</p>

 <p>During the solar eclipse of 1919 one of these red flames rose in less than
 seven hours from a height of 130,000 miles to more than 500,000 miles above
 the sun&#39;s surface. This immense column of red-hot gas, four or five times
 the thickness of the earth, was soaring upward at the rate of 60,000 miles an
 hour.</p>

 <p>These flaming jets or prominences shooting out from the chromosphere are
 not to be seen every day by the naked eye; the dazzling light of the sun
 obscures them, gigantic as they are. They can be observed, however, by the
 spectroscope any day, and they are visible to us for a very short time during
 an eclipse of the sun. Some extraordinary outbursts have been witnessed. Thus
 the late Professor Young described one on September 7, 1871, when he had been
 examining a prominence by the spectroscope:</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>It had remained unchanged since noon of the previous day&mdash;a long,
  low, quiet-looking cloud, not very dense, or brilliant, or in any way
  remarkable except for its size. At 12:30 p.m. the Professor left the
  spectroscope for a short time, and on returning half an hour later to his
  observations, he was astonished to find the gigantic Sun flame shattered to
  pieces. The solar atmosphere was filled with flying debris, and some of
  these portions reached a height of 100,000 miles above the solar surface.
  Moving with a velocity which, even at the distance of 93,000,000 miles, was
  almost perceptible to the eye, these fragments doubled their height in ten
  minutes. On January 30, 1885, another distinguished solar observer, the late
  Professor Tacchini of Rome, observed one of the greatest prominences ever
  seen by man. Its height was no less than 142,000 miles&mdash;eighteen times
  the diameter of the earth. Another mighty flame was so vast that supposing
  the eight large planets of the solar system ranged one on top of the other,
  the prominence would still tower above them.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id=

 <p>The fourth and uppermost layer or region is that of the corona, of immense
 extent and fading away into the surrounding sky&mdash;this we have already
 referred to. The diagram (Fig. 5) shows the dispositions of these various
 layers of the sun. It is through these several transparent layers that we see
 the white light body of the sun.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Surface of the Sun</h4>

 <p>Here let us return to and see what more we know about the
 photosphere&mdash;the sun&#39;s surface. It is from the photosphere that we
 have gained most of our knowledge of the composition of the sun, which is
 believed not to be a solid body. Examination of the photosphere shows that
 the outer surface is never at rest. Small bright cloudlets come and go in
 rapid succession, giving the surface, through contrasts in luminosity, a
 granular appearance. Of course, to be visible at all at 92,830,000 miles the
 cloudlets cannot be small. They imply enormous activity in the photosphere.
 If we might speak picturesquely the sun&#39;s surface resembles a boiling
 ocean of white-hot metal vapours. We have to-day a wonderful instrument,
 which will be described later, which dilutes, as it were, the general glare
 of the sun, and enables us to observe these fiery eruptions at any hour. The
 &quot;oceans&quot; of red-hot gas and white-hot metal vapour at the sun&#39;s
 surface are constantly driven by great storms. Some unimaginable energy
 streams out from the body or muscles of the sun and blows its outer layers
 into gigantic shreds, as it were.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id=
 "Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

 <p>The actual temperature at the sun&#39;s surface, or what appears to us to
 be the surface&mdash;the photosphere&mdash;is, of course, unknown, but
 careful calculation suggests that it is from 5,000° C. to 7,000° C. The
 interior is vastly hotter. We can form no conception of such temperatures as
 must exist there. Not even the most obdurate solid could resist such
 temperatures, but would be converted almost instantaneously into gas. But it
 would not be gas as we know gases on the earth. The enormous pressures that
 exist on the sun must convert even gases into thick treacly fluids. We can
 only infer this state of matter. It is beyond our power to reproduce it.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Sun-spots</h4>

 <p>It is in the brilliant photosphere that the dark areas known as sun-spots
 appear. Some of these dark spots&mdash;they are dark only by contrast with
 the photosphere surrounding them&mdash;are of enormous size, covering many
 thousands of square miles of surface. What they are we cannot positively say.
 They look like great cavities in the sun&#39;s surface. Some think they are
 giant whirlpools. Certainly they seem to be great whirling streams of glowing
 gases with vapours above them and immense upward and downward currents within
 them. Round the edges of the sun-spots rise great tongues of flame.</p>

 <p>Perhaps the most popularly known fact about sun-spots is that they are
 somehow connected with what we call magnetic storms on earth. These magnetic
 storms manifest themselves in interruptions of our telegraphic and telephonic
 communications, in violent disturbances of the mariner&#39;s compass, and in
 exceptional auroral displays. The connection between the two sets of
 phenomena cannot be doubted, even although at times there may be a great spot
 on the sun without any corresponding &quot;magnetic storm&quot; effects on
 the earth.</p>

 <p>A surprising fact about sun-spots is that they show definite periodic
 variations in number. The best-defined period is one of<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> about eleven
 years. During this period the spots increase to a maximum in number and then
 diminish to a minimum, the variation being more or less regular. Now this can
 only mean one thing. To be periodic the spots must have some deep-seated
 connection with the fundamental facts of the sun&#39;s structure and
 activities. Looked at from this point of view their importance becomes
 great.</p>

   <p>THE AURORA BOREALIS</p>
  </div>
 </div>

 <p>The aurora borealis is one of the most beautiful spectacles in the sky.
 The colours and shape change every instant; sometimes a fan-like cluster of
 rays, at other times long golden draperies gliding one over the other. Blue,
 green, yellow, red, and white combine to give a glorious display of colour.
 The theory of its origin is still, in part, obscure, but there can be no
 doubt that the aurora is related to the magnetic phenomena of the earth and
 therefore is connected with the electrical influence of the sun.]</p>

 <p>It is from the study of sun-spots that we have learned that the sun&#39;s
 surface does not appear to rotate all at the same speed. The
 &quot;equatorial&quot; regions are rotating quicker than regions farther
 north or south. A point forty-five degrees from the equator seems to take
 about two and a half days longer to complete one rotation than a point on the
 equator. This, of course, confirms our belief that the sun cannot be a solid
 body.</p>

 <p>What is its composition? We know that there are present, in a gaseous
 state, such well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and magnesium;
 indeed, we know that there is practically every element in the sun that we
 know to be in the earth. How do we know?</p>

 <p>It is from the photosphere, as has been said, that we have won most of our
 knowledge of the sun. The instrument used for this purpose is the
 spectroscope; and before proceeding to deal further with the sun and the
 source of its energy it will be better to describe this instrument.</p>

 <h4>A WONDERFUL INSTRUMENT AND WHAT IT REVEALS</h4>

 <p>The spectroscope is an instrument for analysing light. So important is it
 in the revelations it has given us that it will be best to describe it fully.
 Every substance to be examined must first be made to glow, made luminous; and
 as nearly everything in the heavens <i>is</i> luminous the instrument has a
 great range in Astronomy. And when we speak of analysing light, we mean
 that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
 the light may be broken up into waves of different lengths. What we call
 light is a series of minute waves in ether, and these waves
 are&mdash;measuring them from crest to crest, so to say&mdash;of various
 lengths. Each wave-length corresponds to a colour of the rainbow. The
 shortest waves give us a sensation of violet colour, and the largest waves
 cause a sensation of red. The rainbow, in fact, is a sort of natural
 spectrum. (The meaning of the rainbow is that the moisture-laden air has
 sorted out these waves, in the sun&#39;s light, according to their length.)
 Now the simplest form of spectroscope is a glass prism&mdash;a
 triangular-shaped piece of glass. If white light (sunlight, for example)
 passes through a glass prism, we see a series of rainbow-tinted colours.
 Anyone can notice this effect when sunlight is shining through any kind of
 cut glass&mdash;the stopper of a wine decanter, for instance. If, instead of
 catching with the eye the coloured lights as they emerge from the glass
 prism, we allow them to fall on a screen, we shall find that they pass, by
 continuous gradations, from red at the one end of the screen, through orange,
 yellow, green, blue, and indigo, to violet at the other end. <i>In other
 words, what we call white light is composed of rays of these several colours.
 They go to make up the effect which we call white.</i> And now just as water
 can be split up into its two elements, oxygen and hydrogen, so sunlight can
 be broken up into its primary colours, which are those we have just
 mentioned.</p>

 <p>This range of colours, produced by the spectroscope, we call the solar
 spectrum, and these are, from the spectroscopic point of view, primary
 colours. Each shade of colour has its definite position in the spectrum. That
 is to say, the light of each shade of colour (corresponding to its
 wave-length) is reflected through a certain fixed angle on passing through
 the glass prism. Every possible kind of light has its definite position, and
 is denoted by a number which gives the wave-length of the vibrations
 constituting that particular kind of light.</p>

 <p>Now, other kinds of light besides sunlight can be analysed.<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> Light from any
 substance which has been made incandescent may be observed with the
 spectroscope in the same way, and each element can be thus separated. It is
 found that each substance (in the same conditions of pressure, etc.) gives a
 constant spectrum of its own. <i>Each metal displays its own distinctive
 colour. It is obvious, therefore, that the spectrum provides the means for
 identifying a particular substance.</i> It was by this method that we
 discovered in the sun the presence of such well-known elements as sodium,
 iron, copper, zinc, and magnesium.</p>

 <p>Every chemical element known, then, has a distinctive spectrum of its own
 when it is raised to incandescence, and this distinctive spectrum is as
 reliable a means of identification for the element as a human face is for its
 owner. Whether it is a substance glowing in the laboratory or in a remote
 star makes no difference to the spectroscope; if the light of any substance
 reaches it, that substance will be recognised and identified by the
 characteristic set of waves.</p>

 <p>The spectrum of a glowing mass of gas will consist in a number of bright
 lines of various colours, and at various intervals; corresponding to each
 kind of gas, there will be a peculiar and distinctive arrangement of bright
 lines. But if the light from such a mass of glowing gas be made to pass
 through a cool mass of the <i>same</i> gas it will be found that dark lines
 replace the bright lines in the spectrum, the reason for this being that the
 cool gas absorbs the rays of light emitted by the hot gas. Experiments of
 this kind enable us to reach the important general statement that every gas,
 when cold, absorbs the same rays of light which it emits when hot.</p>

 <p>Crossing the solar spectrum are hundreds and hundreds of dark lines. These
 could not at first be explained, because this fact of discriminative
 absorption was not known. We understand now. The sun&#39;s white light comes
 from the photosphere, but between us and the photosphere there is, as we have
 seen, another solar envelope of relatively cooler vapours&mdash;the
 reversing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg
 24]</a></span> layer. Each constituent element in this outer envelope stops
 its own kind of light, that is, the kind of light made by incandescent atoms
 of the same element in the photosphere. The &quot;stoppages&quot; register
 themselves in the solar spectrum as dark lines placed exactly where the
 corresponding bright lines would have been. The explanation once attained,
 dark lines became as significant as bright lines. The secret of the sun&#39;s
 composition was out. We have found practically every element in the sun that
 we know to be in the earth. We have identified an element in the sun before
 we were able to isolate it on the earth. We have been able even to point to
 the coolest places on the sun, the centres of sun-spots, where alone the
 temperature seems to have fallen sufficiently low to allow chemical compounds
 to form.</p>

 <p>It is thus we have been able to determine what the stars, comets, or
 nebulæ are made of.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">A Unique Discovery</h4>

 <p>In 1868 Sir Norman Lockyer detected a light coming from the prominences of
 the sun which was not given by any substance known on earth, and attributed
 this to an unknown gas which he called helium, from the Greek <i>helios</i>,
 the sun. <i>In 1895 Sir William Ramsay discovered in certain minerals the
 same gas identified by the spectroscope.</i> We can say, therefore, that this
 gas was discovered in the sun nearly thirty years before it was found on
 earth; this discovery of the long-lost heir is as thrilling a chapter in the
 detective story of science as any in the sensational stories of the day, and
 makes us feel quite certain that our methods really tell us of what elements
 sun and stars are built up. The light from the corona of the sun, as we have
 mentioned indicates a gas still unknown on earth, which has been christened
 Coronium.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Measuring the Speed of Light</h4>

 <p>But this is not all; soon a new use was found for the spectroscope. We
 found that we could measure with it the most difficult<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> of all speeds to
 measure, speed in the line of sight. Movement at right angles to the
 direction in which one is looking is, if there is sufficient of it, easy to
 detect, and, if the distance of the moving body is known, easy to measure.
 But movement in the line of vision is both difficult to detect and difficult
 to measure. Yet, even at the enormous distances with which astronomers have
 to deal, the spectroscope can detect such movement and furnish data for its
 measurement. If a luminous body containing, say, sodium is moving rapidly
 towards the spectroscope, it will be found that the sodium lines in the
 spectrum have moved slightly from their usual definite positions towards the
 violet end of the spectrum, the amount of the change of position increasing
 with the speed of the luminous body. If the body is moving away from the
 spectroscope the shifting of the spectral lines will be in the opposite
 direction, towards the red end of the spectrum. In this way we have
 discovered and measured movements that otherwise would probably not have
 revealed themselves unmistakably to us for thousands of years. In the same
 way we have watched, and measured the speed of, tremendous movements on the
 sun, and so gained proof that the vast disturbances we should expect there
 actually do occur.</p>

 <h3>IS THE SUN DYING?</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 3</h3>

 <p>Now let us return to our consideration of the sun.</p>

 <p>To us on the earth the most patent and most astonishing fact about the sun
 is its tremendous energy. Heat and light in amazing quantities pour from it
 without ceasing.</p>

 <p>Where does this energy come from? Enormous jets of red glowing gases can
 be seen shooting outwards from the sun, like flames from a fire, for
 thousands of miles. Does this argue fire, as we know fire on the earth? On
 this point the scientist is sure. The sun is not burning, and combustion is
 not the source of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg
 26]</a></span> heat. Combustion is a chemical reaction between atoms. The
 conditions that make it possible are known and the results are predictable
 and measurable. But no chemical reaction of the nature of combustion as we
 know it will explain the sun&#39;s energy, nor indeed will any ordinary
 chemical reaction of any kind. If the sun were composed of combustible
 material throughout and the conditions of combustion as we understand them
 were always present, the sun would burn itself out in some thousands of
 years, with marked changes in its heat and light production as the process
 advanced. There is no evidence of such changes. There is, instead, strong
 evidence that the sun has been emitting light and heat in prodigious
 quantities, not for thousands, but for millions of years. Every addition to
 our knowledge that throws light on the sun&#39;s age seems to make for
 increase rather than decrease of its years. This makes the wonder of its
 energy greater.</p>

 <p>And we cannot avoid the issue of the source of the energy by saying merely
 that the sun is gradually radiating away an energy that originated in some
 unknown manner, away back at the beginning of things. Reliable calculations
 show that the years required for the mere cooling of a globe like the sun
 could not possibly run to millions. In other words, the sun&#39;s energy must
 be subject to continuous and more or less steady renewal. However it may have
 acquired its enormous energy in the past, it must have some source of energy
 in the present.</p>

 <p>The best explanation that we have to-day of this continuous accretion of
 energy is that it is due to shrinkage of the sun&#39;s bulk under the force
 of gravity. Gravity is one of the most mysterious forces of nature, but it is
 an obvious fact that bodies behave as if they attracted one another, and
 Newton worked out the law of this attraction. We may say, without trying to
 go too deeply into things, that every particle of matter attracts every other
 throughout the universe. If the diameter of the sun were to shrink by one
 mile all round, this would mean that all the millions of tons in
 the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
 outer one-mile thickness would have a straight drop of one mile towards the
 centre. And that is not all, because obviously the layers below this outer
 mile would also drop inwards, each to a less degree than the one above it.
 What a tremendous movement of matter, however slowly it might take place! And
 what a tremendous energy would be involved! Astronomers calculate that the
 above shrinkage of one mile all round would require fifty years for its
 completion, assuming, reasonably, that there is close and continuous
 relationship between loss of heat by radiation and shrinkage. Even if this
 were true we need not feel over-anxious on this theory; before the sun became
 too cold to support life many millions of years would be required.</p>

 <p>It was suggested at one time that falls of meteoric matter into the sun
 would account for the sun&#39;s heat. This position is hardly tenable now.
 The mere bulk of the meteoric matter required by the hypothesis, apart from
 other reasons, is against it. There is undoubtedly an enormous amount of
 meteoric matter moving about within the bounds of the solar system, but most
 of it seems to be following definite routes round the sun like the planets.
 The stray erratic quantities destined to meet their doom by collision with
 the sun can hardly be sufficient to account for the sun&#39;s heat.</p>

 <p>Recent study of radio-active bodies has suggested another factor that may
 be working powerfully along with the force of gravitation to maintain the
 sun&#39;s store of heat. In radio-active bodies certain atoms seem to be
 undergoing disintegration. These atoms appear to be splitting up into very
 minute and primitive constituents. But since matter may be split up into such
 constituents, may it not be built up from them?</p>

 <p>The question is whether these &quot;radio-active&quot; elements are
 undergoing disintegration, or formation, in the sun. If they are undergoing
 disintegration&mdash;and the sun itself is undoubtedly
 radio-active&mdash;then we have another source of heat for the sun that will
 last indefinitely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg

 <h3>THE PLANETS</h3>

 <h3>LIFE IN OTHER WORLDS?</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <p>It is quite clear that there cannot be life on the stars. Nothing solid or
 even liquid can exist in such furnaces as they are. Life exists only on
 planets, and even on these its possibilities are limited. Whether all the
 stars, or how many of them, have planetary families like our sun, we cannot
 positively say. If they have, such planets would be too faint and small to be
 visible tens of trillions of miles away. Some astronomers think that our sun
 may be exceptional in having planets, but their reasons are speculative and
 unconvincing. Probably a large proportion at least of the stars have planets,
 and we may therefore survey the globes of our own solar system and in a
 general way extend the results to the rest of the universe.</p>

 <p>In considering the possibility of life as we know it we may at once rule
 out the most distant planets from the sun, Uranus and Neptune. They are
 probably intrinsically too hot. We may also pass over the nearest planet to
 the sun, Mercury. We have reason to believe that it turns on its axis in the
 same period as it revolves round the sun, and it must therefore always
 present the same side to the sun. This means that the heat on the sunlit side
 of Mercury is above boiling-point, while the cold on the other side must be
 between two and three hundred degrees below freezing-point.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Planet Venus</h4>

 <p>The planet Venus, the bright globe which is known to all as the morning
 and evening &quot;star,&quot; seems at first sight more promising as regards
 the possibility of life. It is of nearly the same size as the earth, and it
 has a good atmosphere, but there are many astronomers who believe that, like
 Mercury, it always presents the same face to the sun, and it would therefore
 have the same disadvantage&mdash;a broiling heat on the sunny side and the
 cold of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg
 29]</a></span> space on the opposite side. We are not sure. The surface of
 Venus is so bright&mdash;the light of the sun is reflected to us by such
 dense masses of cloud and dust&mdash;that it is difficult to trace any
 permanent markings on it, and thus ascertain how long it takes to rotate on
 its axis. Many astronomers believe that they have succeeded, and that the
 planet always turns the same face to the sun. If it does, we can hardly
 conceive of life on its surface, in spite of the cloud-screen.</p>

 <p>We turn to Mars; and we must first make it clear why there is so much
 speculation about life on Mars, and why it is supposed that, if there
 <i>is</i> life on Mars, it must be more advanced than life on the earth.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Is there Life on Mars?</h4>

 <p>The basis of this belief is that if, as we saw, all the globes in our
 solar system are masses of metal that are cooling down, the smaller will have
 cooled down before the larger, and will be further ahead in their
 development. Now Mars is very much smaller than the earth, and must have
 cooled at its surface millions of years before the earth did. Hence, if a
 story of life began on Mars at all, it began long before the story of life on
 the earth. We cannot guess what sort of life-forms would be evolved in a
 different world, but we can confidently say that they would tend toward
 increasing intelligence; and thus we are disposed to look for highly
 intelligent beings on Mars.</p>

 <p>But this argument supposes that the conditions of life, namely air and
 water, are found on Mars, and it is disputed whether they are found there in
 sufficient quantity. The late Professor Percival Lowell, who made a lifelong
 study of Mars, maintained that there are hundreds of straight lines drawn
 across the surface of the planet, and he claimed that they are beds of
 vegetation marking the sites of great channels or pipes by means of which the
 &quot;Martians&quot; draw water from their polar ocean. Professor<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> W. H. Pickering,
 another high authority, thinks that the lines are long, narrow marshes fed by
 moist winds from the poles. There are certainly white polar caps on Mars.
 They seem to melt in the spring, and the dark fringe round them grows
 broader.</p>

 <p>Other astronomers, however, say that they find no trace of water-vapour in
 the atmosphere of Mars, and they think that the polar caps may be simply thin
 sheets of hoar-frost or frozen gas. They point out that, as the atmosphere of
 Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the sun is so great, it may
 be too cold for the fluid water to exist on the planet.</p>

 <p>If one asks why our wonderful instruments cannot settle these points, one
 must be reminded that Mars is never nearer than 34,000,000 miles from the
 earth, and only approaches to this distance once in fifteen or seventeen
 years. The image of Mars on the photographic negative taken in a big
 telescope is very small. Astronomers rely to a great extent on the eye, which
 is more sensitive than the photographic plate. But it is easy to have
 differences of opinion as to what the eye sees, and so there is a good deal
 of controversy.</p>

 <p>In August, 1924, the planet will again be well placed for observation, and
 we may learn more about it. Already a few of the much-disputed lines, which
 people wrongly call &quot;canals,&quot; have been traced on photographs.
 Astronomers who are sceptical about life on Mars are often not fully aware of
 the extraordinary adaptability of life. There was a time when the climate of
 the whole earth, from pole to pole, was semi-tropical for millions of years.
 No animal could then endure the least cold, yet now we have plenty of Arctic
 plants and animals. If the cold came slowly on Mars, as we have reason to
 suppose, the population could be gradually adapted to it. On the whole, it is
 possible that there is advanced life on Mars, and it is not impossible, in
 spite of the very great difficulties of a code of communication, that our
 &quot;elder brothers&quot; may yet flash across space the solution of many of
 our problems.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg
 31]</a></span></p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Jupiter and Saturn</h4>

 <p>Next to Mars, going outward from the sun, is Jupiter. Between Mars and
 Jupiter, however, there are more than three hundred million miles of space,
 and the older astronomers wondered why this was not occupied by a planet. We
 now know that it contains about nine hundred &quot;planetoids,&quot; or small
 globes of from five to five hundred miles in diameter. It was at one time
 thought that a planet might have burst into these fragments (a theory which
 is not mathematically satisfactory), or it may be that the material which is
 scattered in them was prevented by the nearness of the great bulk of Jupiter
 from uniting into one globe.</p>

 <p>For Jupiter is a giant planet, and its gravitational influence must extend
 far over space. It is 1,300 times as large as the earth, and has nine moons,
 four of which are large, in attendance on it. It is interesting to note that
 the outermost moons of Jupiter and Saturn revolve round these planets in a
 direction contrary to the usual direction taken by moons round planets, and
 by planets round the sun. But there is no life on Jupiter.</p>

 <p>The surface which we see in photographs (Fig. 12) is a mass of cloud or
 steam which always envelops the body of the planet. It is apparently red-hot.
 A red tinge is seen sometimes at the edges of its cloud-belts, and a large
 red region (the &quot;red spot&quot;), 23,000 miles in length, has been
 visible on it for half a century. There may be a liquid or solid core to the
 planet, but as a whole it is a mass of seething vapours whirling round on its
 axis once in every ten hours. As in the case of the sun, however, different
 latitudes appear to rotate at different rates. The interior of Jupiter is
 very hot, but the planet is not self-luminous. The planets Venus and Jupiter
 shine very brightly, but they have no light of their own; they reflect the
 sunlight.</p>

 <p>Saturn is in the same interesting condition. The surface in the photograph
 (Fig. 13) is steam, and Saturn is so far away<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> from the sun that the vaporisation
 of its oceans must necessarily be due to its own internal heat. It is too hot
 for water to settle on its surface. Like Jupiter, the great globe turns on
 its axis once in ten hours&mdash;a prodigious speed&mdash;and must be a
 swirling, seething mass of metallic vapours and gases. It is instructive to
 compare Jupiter and Saturn in this respect with the sun. They are smaller
 globes and have cooled down more than the central fire.</p>

 <p>Saturn is a beautiful object in the telescope because it has ten moons (to
 include one which is disputed) and a wonderful system of &quot;rings&quot;
 round it. The so-called rings are a mighty swarm of meteorites&mdash;pieces
 of iron and stone of all sorts and sizes, which reflect the light of the sun
 to us. This ocean of matter is some miles deep, and stretches from a few
 thousand miles from the surface of the planet to 172,000 miles out in space.
 Some astronomers think that this is volcanic material which has been shot out
 of the planet. Others regard it as stuff which would have combined to form an
 eleventh moon but was prevented by the nearness of Saturn itself. There is no
 evidence of life on Saturn.</p>

 <h3>THE MOON</h3>

 <p>Mars and Venus are therefore the only planets, besides the earth, on which
 we may look for life; and in the case of Venus, the possibility is very
 faint. But what about the moons which attend the planets? They range in size
 from the little ten-miles-wide moons of Mars, to Titan, a moon of Saturn, and
 Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter, which are about 3,000 miles in diameter.
 May there not be life on some of the larger of these moons? We will take our
 own moon as a type of the class.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">A Dead World</h4>

 <p>The moon is so very much nearer to us than any other heavenly body that we
 have a remarkable knowledge of it. In Fig. 14 you have a photograph, taken in
 one of our largest telescopes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id=
 "Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> of part of its surface. In a sense such a
 telescope brings the moon to within about fifty miles of us. We should see a
 city like London as a dark, sprawling blotch on the globe. We could just
 detect a Zeppelin or a Diplodocus as a moving speck against the surface. But
 we find none of these things. It is true that a few astronomers believe that
 they see signs of some sort of feeble life or movement on the moon. Professor
 Pickering thinks that he can trace some volcanic activity. He believes that
 there are areas of vegetation, probably of a low order, and that the soil of
 the moon may retain a certain amount of water in it. He speaks of a very thin
 atmosphere, and of occasional light falls of snow. He has succeeded in
 persuading some careful observers that there probably are slight changes of
 some kind taking place on the moon.</p>

 </div>

 <p>But there are many things that point to absence of air on the moon. Even
 the photographs we reproduce tell the same story. The edges of the shadows
 are all hard and black. If there had been an appreciable atmosphere it would
 have scattered the sun&#39;s light on to the edges and produced a gradual
 shading off such as we see on the earth. This relative absence of air must
 give rise to some surprising effects. There will be no sounds on the moon,
 because sounds are merely air waves. Even a meteor shattering itself to a
 violent end against the surface of the moon would make no noise. Nor would it
 herald its coming by glowing into a &quot;shooting star,&quot; as it would on
 entering the earth&#39;s atmosphere. There will be no floating dust, no
 scent, no twilight, no blue sky, no twinkling of the stars. The sky will be
 always black and the stars will be clearly visible by day as by night. The
 sun&#39;s wonderful corona, which no man on earth, even by seizing every
 opportunity during eclipses, can hope to see for more than two hours in all
 in a long lifetime, will be visible all day. So will the great red flames of
 the sun. Of course, there will be no life, and no landscape effects and
 scenery effects due to vegetation.</p>

 <p>The moon takes approximately twenty-seven of our days to<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> turn once on its
 axis. So for fourteen days there is continuous night, when the temperature
 must sink away down towards the absolute cold of space. This will be followed
 without an instant of twilight by full daylight. For another fourteen days
 the sun&#39;s rays will bear straight down, with no diffusion or absorption
 of their heat, or light, on the way. It does not follow, however, that the
 temperature of the moon&#39;s surface must rise enormously. It may not even
 rise to the temperature of melting ice. Seeing there is no air there can be
 no check on radiation. The heat that the moon gets will radiate away
 immediately. We know that amongst the coldest places on the earth are the
 tops of very high mountains, the points that have reared themselves nearest
 to the sun but farthest out of the sheltering blanket of the earth&#39;s
 atmosphere. The actual temperature of the moon&#39;s surface by day is a moot
 point. It may be below the freezing-point or above the boiling-point of
 water.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Mountains of the Moon</h4>

 <p>The lack of air is considered by many astronomers to furnish the
 explanation of the enormous number of &quot;craters&quot; which pit the
 moon&#39;s surface. There are about a hundred thousand of these strange
 rings, and it is now believed by many that they are spots where very large
 meteorites, or even planetoids, splashed into the moon when its surface was
 still soft. Other astronomers think that they are the remains of gigantic
 bubbles which were raised in the moon&#39;s &quot;skin,&quot; when the globe
 was still molten, by volcanic gases from below. A few astronomers think that
 they are, as is popularly supposed, the craters of extinct volcanoes. Our
 craters, on the earth, are generally deep cups, whereas these ring-formations
 on the moon are more like very shallow and broad saucers. Clavius, the
 largest of them, is 123 miles across the interior, yet its encircling rampart
 is not a mile high.</p>

 <p>The mountains on the moon (Fig. 16) rise to a great height,<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> and are
 extraordinarily gaunt and rugged. They are like fountains of lava, rising in
 places to 26,000 and 27,000 feet. The lunar Apennines have three thousand
 steep and weird peaks. Our terrestrial mountains are continually worn down by
 frost acting on moisture and by ice and water, but there are none of these
 agencies operating on the moon. Its mountains are comparatively
 &quot;everlasting hills.&quot;</p>

 <p>The moon is interesting to us precisely because it is a dead world. It
 seems to show how the earth, or any cooling metal globe, will evolve in the
 remote future. We do not know if there was ever life on the moon, but in any
 case it cannot have proceeded far in development. At the most we can imagine
 some strange lowly forms of vegetation lingering here and there in pools of
 heavy gas, expanding during the blaze of the sun&#39;s long day, and frozen
 rigid during the long night.</p>

 <h3>METEORS AND COMETS</h3>

 <p>We may conclude our survey of the solar system with a word about
 &quot;shooting stars,&quot; or meteors, and comets. There are few now who do
 not know that the streak of fire which suddenly lights the sky overhead at
 night means that a piece of stone or iron has entered our atmosphere from
 outer space, and has been burned up by friction. It was travelling at,
 perhaps, twenty or thirty miles a second. At seventy or eighty miles above
 our heads it began to glow, as at that height the air is thick enough to
 offer serious friction and raise it to a white heat. By the time the meteor
 reached about twenty miles or so from the earth&#39;s surface it was entirely
 dissipated, as a rule in fiery vapour.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Millions of Meteorites</h4>

 <p>It is estimated that between ten and a hundred million meteorites enter
 our atmosphere and are cremated, every day.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> Most of them weigh only an ounce or
 two, and are invisible. Some of them weigh a ton or more, but even against
 these large masses the air acts as a kind of &quot;torpedo-net.&quot; They
 generally burst into fragments and fall without doing damage.</p>

 <p>It is clear that &quot;empty space&quot; is, at least within the limits of
 our solar system, full of these things. They swarm like fishes in the seas.
 Like the fishes, moreover, they may be either solitary or gregarious. The
 solitary bit of cosmic rubbish is the meteorite, which we have just examined.
 A &quot;social&quot; group of meteorites is the essential part of a comet.
 The nucleus, or bright central part, of the head of a comet (Fig. 19)
 consists of a swarm, sometimes thousands of miles wide, of these pieces of
 iron or stone. This swarm has come under the sun&#39;s gravitational
 influence, and is forced to travel round it. From some dark region of space
 it has moved slowly into our system. It is not then a comet, for it has no
 tail. But as the crowded meteors approach the sun, the speed increases. They
 give off fine vapour-like matter and the fierce flood of light from the sun
 sweeps this vapour out in an ever-lengthening tail. Whatever way the comet is
 travelling, the tail always points away from the sun.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">A Great Comet</h4>

 <p>The vapoury tail often grows to an enormous length as the comet approaches
 the sun. The great comet of 1843 had a tail two hundred million miles long.
 It is, however, composed of the thinnest vapours imaginable. Twice during the
 nineteenth century the earth passed through the tail of a comet, and nothing
 was felt. The vapours of the tail are, in fact, so attenuated that we can
 hardly imagine them to be white-hot. They may be lit by some electrical
 force. However that may be, the comet dashes round the sun, often at three or
 four hundred miles a second, then may pass gradually out of our system once
 more. It may be a thousand years, or it may be fifty years,
 before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
 the monarch of the system will summon it again to make its fiery journey
 round his throne.</p>

 <h3>THE STELLAR UNIVERSE</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <p>The immensity of the Stellar Universe, as we have seen, is beyond our
 apprehension. The sun is nothing more than a very ordinary star, perhaps an
 insignificant one. There are stars enormously greater than the sun. One such,
 Betelgeux, has recently been measured, and its diameter is more than 300
 times that of the sun.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Evolution of Stars</h4>

 <p>The proof of the similarity between our sun and the stars has come to us
 through the spectroscope. The elements that we find by its means in the sun
 are also found in the same way in the stars. Matter, says the spectroscope,
 is essentially the same everywhere, in the earth and the sun, in the comet
 that visits us once in a thousand years, in the star whose distance is
 incalculable, and in the great clouds of &quot;fire-mist&quot; that we call
 nebulæ.</p>

 <p>In considering the evolution of the stars let us keep two points clearly
 in mind. The starting-point, the nebula, is no figment of the scientific
 imagination. Hundreds of thousands of nebulæ, besides even vaster irregular
 stretches of nebulous matter, exist in the heavens. But the stages of the
 evolution of this stuff into stars are very largely a matter of speculation.
 Possibly there is more than one line of evolution, and the various theories
 may be reconciled. And this applies also to the theories of the various
 stages through which the stars themselves pass on their way to
 extinction.</p>

 <p>The light of about a quarter of a million stars has been analysed in the
 spectroscope, and it is found that they fall into about<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> a dozen classes
 which generally correspond to stages in their evolution (Fig. 21).</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Age of Stars</h4>

 <p>In its main lines the spectrum of a star corresponds to its colour, and we
 may roughly group the stars into red, yellow, and white. This is also the
 order of increasing temperature, the red stars being the coolest and the
 white stars the hottest. We might therefore imagine that the white stars are
 the youngest, and that as they grow older and cooler they become yellowish,
 then red, and finally become invisible&mdash;just as a cooling white-hot iron
 would do. But a very interesting recent research shows that there are two
 kinds of red stars; some of them are amongst the oldest stars and some are
 amongst the youngest. The facts appear to be that when a star is first formed
 it is not very hot. It is an immense mass of diffuse gas glowing with a
 dull-red heat. It contracts under the mutual gravitation of its particles,
 and as it does so it grows hotter. It acquires a yellowish tinge. As it
 continues to contract it grows hotter and hotter until its temperature
 reaches a maximum as a white star. At this point the contraction process does
 not stop, but the heating process does. Further contraction is now
 accompanied by cooling, and the star goes through its colour changes again,
 but this time in the inverse order. It contracts and cools to yellow and
 finally to red. But when it again becomes a red star it is enormously denser
 and smaller than when it began as a red star. Consequently the red stars are
 divided into two classes called, appropriately, Giants and Dwarfs. This
 theory, which we owe to an American astronomer, H. N. Russell, has been
 successful in explaining a variety of phenomena, and there is consequently
 good reason to suppose it to be true. But the question as to how the red
 giant stars were formed has received less satisfactory and precise
 answers.</p>

 <p>The most commonly accepted theory is the nebular theory.<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

 <h3>THE NEBULAR THEORY</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <p>Nebulæ are dim luminous cloud-like patches in the heavens, more like wisps
 of smoke in some cases than anything else. Both photography and the telescope
 show that they are very numerous, hundreds of thousands being already known
 and the number being continually added to. They are not small. Most of them
 are immensely large. Actual dimensions cannot be given, because to estimate
 these we must first know definitely the distance of the nebulæ from the
 earth. The distances of some nebulæ are known approximately, and we can
 therefore form some idea of size in these cases. The results are staggering.
 The mere visible surface of some nebulæ is so large that the whole stretch of
 the solar system would be too small to form a convenient unit for measuring
 it. A ray of light would require to travel for years to cross from side to
 side of such a nebula. Its immensity is inconceivable to the human mind.</p>

 <p>There appear to be two types of nebulæ, and there is evidence suggesting
 that the one type is only an earlier form of the other; but this again we do
 not know.</p>

 <p>The more primitive nebulæ would seem to be composed of gas in an extremely
 rarified form. It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of the rarity of
 nebular gases. The residual gases in a vacuum tube are dense by comparison. A
 cubic inch of air at ordinary pressure would contain more matter than is
 contained in millions of cubic inches of the gases of nebulæ. The light of
 even the faintest stars does not seem to be dimmed by passing through a
 gaseous nebula, although we cannot be sure on this point. The most remarkable
 physical fact about these gases is that they are luminous. Whence they derive
 their luminosity we do not know. It hardly seems possible to believe that
 extremely thin gases exposed to the terrific cold of space can be so hot as
 to be luminous and can retain their heat and their luminosity<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> indefinitely. A
 cold luminosity due to electrification, like that of the aurora borealis,
 would seem to fit the case better.</p>

 <p>Now the nebular theory is that out of great &quot;fire-mists,&quot; such
 as we have described, stars are born. We do not know whether gravitation is
 the only or even the main force at work in a nebula, but it is supposed that
 under the action of gravity the far-flung &quot;fire-mists&quot; would begin
 to condense round centres of greatest density, heat being evolved in the
 process. Of course the condensation would be enormously slow, although the
 sudden irruption of a swarm of meteors or some solid body might hasten
 matters greatly by providing large, ready-made centres of condensation.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Spiral Nebulæ</h4>

 <p>It is then supposed that the contracting mass of gas would begin to rotate
 and to throw off gigantic streamers, which would in their turn form centres
 of condensation. The whole structure would thus form a spiral, having a dense
 region at its centre and knots or lumps of condensed matter along its spiral
 arms. Besides the formless gaseous nebulæ there are hundreds of thousands of
 &quot;spiral&quot; nebulæ such as we have just mentioned in the heavens. They
 are at all stages of development, and they are visible to us at all
 angles&mdash;that is to say, some of them face directly towards us, others
 are edge on, and some are in intermediate positions. It appears, therefore,
 that we have here a striking confirmation of the nebular hypothesis. But we
 must not go so fast. There is much controversy as to the nature of these
 spiral nebulæ. Some eminent astronomers think they are other stellar
 universes, comparable in size with our own. In any case they are vast
 structures, and if they represent stars in process of condensation, they must
 be giving birth to huge agglomerations of stars&mdash;to star clusters at
 least. These vast and enigmatic objects do not throw much light on the origin
 of our own solar system. The nebular hypothesis, which was invented
 by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
 Laplace to explain the origin of our solar system, has not yet met with
 universal acceptance. The explanation offers grave difficulties, and it is
 best while the subject is still being closely investigated, to hold all
 opinions with reserve. It may be taken as probable, however, that the
 universe has developed from masses of incandescent gas.</p>

 <h3>THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF STARS</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 3</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Variable, New, and Dark Stars: Dying Suns</h4>

 <p>Many astronomers believe that in &quot;variable stars&quot; we have
 another star, following that of the dullest red star, in the dying of suns.
 The light of these stars varies periodically in so many days, weeks, or
 years. It is interesting to speculate that they are slowly dying suns, in
 which the molten interior periodically bursts through the shell of thick
 vapours that is gathering round them. What we saw about our sun seems to
 point to some such stage in the future. That is, however, not the received
 opinion about variable stars. It may be that they are stars which
 periodically pass through a great swarm of meteors or a region of space that
 is rich in cosmic dust of some sort, when, of course, a great illumination
 would take place.</p>

 <p>One class of these variable stars, which takes its name from the star
 Algol, is of special interest. Every third night Algol has its light reduced
 for several hours. Modern astronomy has discovered that in this case there
 are really two stars, circulating round a common centre, and that every third
 night the fainter of the two comes directly between us and its companion and
 causes an &quot;eclipse.&quot; This was until recently regarded as a most
 interesting case in which a dead star revealed itself to us by passing before
 the light of another star. But astronomers have in recent years invented
 something, the &quot;selenium-cell,&quot; which is even more sensitive than
 the photographic plate, and on this the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> supposed dead star registers itself
 as very much alive. Algol is, however, interesting in another way. The pair
 of stars which we have discovered in it are hundreds of trillions of miles
 away from the earth, yet we know their masses and their distances from each
 other.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Death and Birth of Stars</h4>

 <p>We have no positive knowledge of dead stars; which is not surprising when
 we reflect that a dead star means an invisible star! But when we see so many
 individual stars tending toward death, when we behold a vast population of
 all conceivable ages, we presume that there are many already dead. On the
 other hand, there is no reason to suppose that the universe as a whole is
 &quot;running down.&quot; Some writers have maintained this, but their
 argument implies that we know a great deal more about the universe than we
 actually do. The scientific man does not know whether the universe is finite
 or infinite, temporal or eternal; and he declines to speculate where there
 are no facts to guide him. He knows only that the great gaseous nebulæ
 promise myriads of worlds in the future, and he concedes the possibility that
 new nebulæ may be forming in the ether of space.</p>

 <p>The last, and not the least interesting, subject we have to notice is the
 birth of a &quot;new star.&quot; This is an event which astronomers now
 announce every few years; and it is a far more portentous event than the
 reader imagines when it is reported in his daily paper. The story is much the
 same in all cases. We say that the star appeared in 1901, but you begin to
 realise the magnitude of the event when you learn that the distant
 &quot;blaze&quot; had really occurred about the time of the death of Luther!
 The light of the conflagration had been speeding toward us across space at
 186,000 miles a second, yet it has taken nearly three centuries to reach us.
 To be visible at all to us at that distance the fiery outbreak must have been
 stupendous. If a mass of petroleum ten times the size of the earth were
 suddenly fired it would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id=
 "Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> be seen at such a distance. The new star had
 increased its light many hundredfold in a few days.</p>

 <p>There is a considerable fascination about the speculation that in such
 cases we see the resurrection of a dead world, a means of renewing the
 population of the universe. What happens is that in some region of the sky
 where no star, or only a very faint star, had been registered on our charts,
 we almost suddenly perceive a bright star. In a few days it may rise to the
 highest brilliancy. By the spectroscope we learn that this distant blaze
 means a prodigious outpour of white-hot hydrogen at hundreds of miles a
 second. But the star sinks again after a few months, and we then find a
 nebula round it on every side. It is natural to suppose that a dead or dying
 sun has somehow been reconverted in whole or in part into a nebula. A few
 astronomers think that it may have partially collided with another star, or
 approached too closely to another, with the result we described on an earlier
 page. The general opinion now is that a faint or dead star had rushed into
 one of those regions of space in which there are immense stretches of
 nebulous matter, and been (at least in part) vaporised by the friction.</p>

 <p>But the difficulties are considerable, and some astronomers prefer to
 think that the blazing star may merely have lit up a dark nebula which
 already existed. It is one of those problems on which speculation is most
 tempting but positive knowledge is still very incomplete. We may be content,
 even proud, that already we can take a conflagration that has occurred more
 than a thousand trillion miles away and analyse it positively into an
 outflame of glowing hydrogen gas at so many miles a second.</p>

 <h3>THE SHAPE OF OUR UNIVERSE</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 4</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Our Universe a Spiral Nebula</h4>

 <p>What is the shape of our universe, and what are its dimensions? This is a
 tremendous question to ask. It is like asking<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> an intelligent insect, living on a
 single leaf in the midst of a great Brazilian forest, to say what is the
 shape and size of the forest. Yet man&#39;s ingenuity has proved equal to
 giving an answer even to this question, and by a method exactly similar to
 that which would be adopted by the insect. Suppose, for instance, that the
 forest was shaped as an elongated oval, and the insect lived on a tree near
 the centre of the oval. If the trees were approximately equally spaced from
 one another they would appear much denser along the length of the oval than
 across its width. This is the simple consideration that has guided
 astronomers in determining the shape of our stellar universe. There is one
 direction in the heavens along which the stars appear denser than in the
 directions at right angles to it. That direction is the direction in which we
 look towards the Milky Way. If we count the number of stars visible all over
 the heavens, we find they become more and more numerous as we approach the
 Milky Way. As we go farther and farther from the Milky Way the stars thin out
 until they reach a maximum sparseness in directions at right angles to the
 plane of the Milky Way. We may consider the Milky Way to form, as it were,
 the equator of our system, and the line at right angles to point to the north
 and south poles.</p>

 <p>Our system, in fact, is shaped something like a lens, and our sun is
 situated near the centre of this lens. In the remoter part of this lens, near
 its edge, or possibly outside it altogether, lies the great series of star
 clouds which make up the Milky Way. All the stars are in motion within this
 system, but the very remarkable discovery has been made that these motions
 are not entirely random. The great majority of the stars whose motions can be
 measured fall into two groups drifting past one another in opposite
 directions. The velocity of one stream relative to the other is about
 twenty-five miles per second. The stars forming these two groups are
 thoroughly well mixed; it is not a case of an inner stream going one way and
 an outer stream the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg
 45]</a></span> other. But there are not quite as many stars going one way as
 the other. For every two stars in one stream there are three in the other.
 Now, as we have said, some eminent astronomers hold that the spiral nebulæ
 are universes like our own, and if we look at the two photographs (Figs. 25
 and 26) we see that these spirals present features which, in the light of
 what we have just said about our system, are very remarkable. The nebula in
 Coma Berenices is a spiral edge-on to us, and we see that it has precisely
 the lens-shaped middle and the general flattened shape that we have found in
 our own system. The nebula in Canes Venatici is a spiral facing towards us,
 and its shape irresistibly suggests motions along the spiral arms. This
 motion, whether it is towards or away from the central, lens-shaped portion,
 would cause a double streaming motion in that central portion of the kind we
 have found in our own system. Again, and altogether apart from these
 considerations, there are good reasons for supposing our Milky Way to possess
 a double-armed spiral structure. And the great patches of dark absorbing
 matter which are known to exist in the Milky Way (see Fig. 22) would give
 very much the mottled appearance we notice in the arms (which we see edge-on)
 of the nebula in Coma Berenices. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46"
 id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> hypothesis, therefore, that our universe is a
 spiral nebula has much to be said for it. If it be accepted it greatly
 increases our estimate of the size of the material universe. For our central,
 lens-shaped system is calculated to extend towards the Milky Way for more
 than twenty thousand times a million million miles, and about a third of this
 distance towards what we have called the poles. If, as we suppose, each
 spiral nebula is an independent stellar universe comparable in size with our
 own, then, since there are hundreds of thousands of spiral nebulæ, we see
 that the size of the whole material universe is indeed beyond our
 comprehension.</p>

 questions that engage the attention of modern astronomers. Many of these
 questions have not yet passed the controversial stage; out of these will
 emerge the astronomy of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id=

 that, whatever advances the future holds in store, the science of the heavens

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Telescope</h4>

 <p>The instruments used in modern astronomy are amongst the finest triumphs
 of mechanical skill in the world. In a great modern observatory the different
 instruments are to be counted by the score, but there are two which stand out
 pre-eminent as the fundamental instruments of modern astronomy. These
 instruments are the telescope and the spectroscope, and without them
 astronomy, as we know it, could not exist.</p>

 <p>There is still some dispute as to where and when the first telescope was
 constructed; as an astronomical instrument, however, it dates from the time
 of the great Italian scientist Galileo, who, with a very small and imperfect
 telescope of his own invention, first observed the spots on the sun, the
 mountains of the moon, and the chief four satellites of Jupiter. A good pair
 of modern binoculars is superior to this early instrument of Galileo&#39;s,
 and the history of telescope construction, from that primitive instrument to
 the modern giant recently erected on Mount Wilson, California, is an exciting
 chapter in human progress. But the early instruments have only an historic
 interest: the era of modern telescopes begins in the nineteenth century.</p>

 <p>During the last century telescope construction underwent an unprecedented
 development. An immense amount of interest was taken in the construction of
 large telescopes, and the different countries of the world entered on an
 exciting race to produce the most powerful possible instruments. Besides
 this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
 rivalry of different countries there was a rivalry of methods. The telescope
 developed along two different lines, and each of these two types has its
 partisans at the present day. These types are known as <i>refractors</i> and
 <i>reflectors</i>, and it is necessary to mention, briefly, the principles
 employed in each. The <i>refractor</i> is the ordinary, familiar type of
 telescope. It consists, essentially, of a large lens at one end of a tube,
 and a small lens, called the eye-piece, at the other. The function of the
 large lens is to act as a sort of gigantic eye. It collects a large amount of
 light, an amount proportional to its size, and brings this light to a focus
 within the tube of the telescope. It thus produces a small but bright image,
 and the eye-piece magnifies this image. In the <i>reflector</i>, instead of a
 large lens at the top of the tube, a large mirror is placed at the bottom.
 This mirror is so shaped as to reflect the light that falls on it to a focus,
 whence the light is again led to an eye-piece. Thus the refractor and the
 reflector differ chiefly in their manner of gathering light. The powerfulness
 of the telescope depends on the size of the light-gatherer. A telescope with
 a lens four inches in diameter is four times as powerful as the one with a
 lens two inches in diameter, for the amount of light gathered obviously
 depends on the <i>area</i> of the lens, and the area varies as the
 <i>square</i> of the diameter.</p>

 <p>The largest telescopes at present in existence are <i>reflectors</i>. It
 is much easier to construct a very large mirror than to construct a very
 large lens; it is also cheaper. A mirror is more likely to get out of order
 than is a lens, however, and any irregularity in the shape of a mirror
 produces a greater distorting effect than in a lens. A refractor is also more
 convenient to handle than is a reflector. For these reasons great refractors
 are still made, but the largest of them, the great Yerkes&#39; refractor, is
 much smaller than the greatest reflector, the one on Mount Wilson,
 California. The lens of the Yerkes&#39; refractor measures three feet four
 inches in diameter, whereas the Mount Wilson reflector has a diameter of no
 less than eight feet four inches.</p>

 <p>But there is a device whereby the power of these giant instruments, great
 as it is, can be still further heightened. That device is the simple one of
 allowing the photographic plate to take the place of the human eye. Nowadays
 an astronomer seldom spends the night with his eye glued to the great
 telescope. He puts a photographic plate there. The photographic plate has
 this advantage over the eye, that it builds up impressions. However long we
 stare at an object too faint to be seen, we shall never see it. With the
 photographic plate, however, faint impressions go on accumulating. As hour
 after hour passes, the star which was too faint to make a perceptible
 impression on the plate goes on affecting it until finally it makes an
 impression which can be made visible. In this way the photographic plate
 reveals to us phenomena in the heavens which cannot be seen even through the
 most powerful telescopes.</p>

 <p>Telescopes of the kind we have been discussing, telescopes for exploring
 the heavens, are mounted <i>equatorially</i>; that is to say, they are
 mounted on an inclined pillar parallel to the axis of the earth so that, by
 rotating round this pillar, the telescope is enabled to follow the apparent
 motion of a star due to the rotation of the earth. This motion is effected by
 clock-work, so that, once adjusted on a star, and the clock-work started, the
 telescope remains adjusted on that star for any length of time that is
 desired. But a great official observatory, such as Greenwich Observatory or
 the Observatory at Paris, also has <i>transit</i> instruments, or telescopes
 smaller than the equatorials and without the same facility of movement, but
 which, by a number of exquisite refinements, are more adapted to accurate
 measurements. It is these instruments which are chiefly used in the
 compilation of the <i>Nautical Almanac</i>. They do not follow the apparent
 motions of the stars. Stars are allowed to drift across the field of vision,
 and as each star crosses a small group of parallel wires in the eye-piece its
 precise time of passage is recorded. Owing to their relative fixity of
 position these instruments can be constructed to record the<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> <i>positions</i>
 of stars with much greater accuracy than is possible to the more general and
 flexible mounting of equatorials. The recording of transit is comparatively
 dry work; the spectacular element is entirely absent; stars are treated
 merely as mathematical points. But these observations furnish the very basis
 of modern mathematical astronomy, and without them such publications as the
 <i>Nautical Almanac</i> and the <i>Connaissance du Temps</i> would be robbed
 of the greater part of their importance.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Spectroscope</h4>

 <p>We have already learnt something of the principles of the spectroscope,
 the instrument which, by making it possible to learn the actual constitution
 of the stars, has added a vast new domain to astronomy. In the simplest form
 of this instrument the analysing portion consists of a single prism. Unless
 the prism is very large, however, only a small degree of dispersion is
 obtained. It is obviously desirable, for accurate analytical work, that the
 dispersion&mdash;that is, the separation of the different parts of the
 spectrum&mdash;should be as great as possible. The dispersion can be
 increased by using a large number of prisms, the light emerging from the
 first prism, entering the second, and so on. In this way each prism produces
 its own dispersive effect and, when a number of prisms are employed, the
 final dispersion is considerable. A considerable amount of light is absorbed
 in this way, however, so that unless our primary source of light is very
 strong, the final spectrum will be very feeble and hard to decipher.</p>

 <p>Another way of obtaining considerable dispersion is by using a
 <i>diffraction grating</i> instead of a prism. This consists essentially of a
 piece of glass on which lines are ruled by a diamond point. When the lines
 are sufficiently close together they split up light falling on them into its
 constituents and produce a spectrum.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51"
 id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> The modern diffraction grating is a truly
 wonderful piece of work. It contains several thousands of lines to the inch,
 and these lines have to be spaced with the greatest accuracy. But in this
 instrument, again, there is a considerable loss of light.</p>

 <p>We have said that every substance has its own distinctive spectrum, and it
 might be thought that, when a list of the spectra of different substances has
 been prepared, spectrum analysis would become perfectly straightforward. In
 practice, however, things are not quite so simple. The spectrum emitted by a
 substance is influenced by a variety of conditions. The pressure, the
 temperature, the state of motion of the object we are observing, all make a
 difference, and one of the most laborious tasks of the modern spectroscopist
 is to disentangle these effects from one another. Simple as it is in its
 broad outlines, spectroscopy is, in reality, one of the most intricate
 branches of modern science.</p>

 <h2>THE STORY OF EVOLUTION</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>

 <h3>THE BEGINNING OF THE EARTH&mdash;MAKING A HOME FOR LIFE&mdash;THE FIRST
 LIVING CREATURES</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <p>The Evolution-idea is a master-key that opens many doors. It is a luminous
 interpretation of the world, throwing the light of the past upon the present.
 Everything is seen to be an antiquity, with a history behind it&mdash;a
 <i>natural history</i>, which enables us to understand in some measure how it
 has come to be as it is. We cannot say more than &quot;understand in some
 measure,&quot; for while the <i>fact</i> of evolution is certain, we are only
 beginning to discern the <i>factors</i> that have been at work.</p>

 <p>The evolution-idea is very old, going back to some of the Greek
 philosophers, but it is only in modern times that it has become an essential
 part of our mental equipment. It is now an everyday intellectual tool. It was
 applied to the origin of the solar system and to the making of the earth
 before it was applied to plants and animals; it was extended from these to
 man himself; it spread to language, to folk-ways, to institutions. Within
 recent years the evolution-idea has been applied to the chemical elements,
 for it appears that uranium may change into radium, that radium may produce
 helium, and that lead is the final stable result when the changes of uranium
 are complete. Perhaps all the elements may be the outcome of an inorganic
 evolution. Not less important is the extension of the evolution-idea to the
 world within as well as to the world without. For alongside of the evolution
 of bodies and brains is the evolution of feelings and emotions, ideas and
 imagination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg
 56]</a></span></p>

 <p>Organic evolution means that the present is the child of the past and the
 parent of the future. It is not a power or a principle; it is a
 process&mdash;a process of becoming. It means that the present-day animals
 and plants and all the subtle inter-relations between them have arisen in a
 natural knowable way from a preceding state of affairs on the whole somewhat
 simpler, and that again from forms and inter-relations simpler still, and so
 on backwards and backwards for millions of years till we lose all clues in
 the thick mist that hangs over life&#39;s beginnings.</p>

 <p>Our solar system was once represented by a nebula of some sort, and we may
 speak of the evolution of the sun and the planets. But since it has been
 <i>the same material throughout</i> that has changed in its distribution and
 forms, it might be clearer to use some word like genesis. Similarly, our
 human institutions were once very different from what they are now, and we
 may speak of the evolution of government or of cities. But Man works with a
 purpose, with ideas and ideals in some measure controlling his actions and
 guiding his achievements, so that it is probably clearer to keep the good old
 word history for all processes of social becoming in which man has been a
 conscious agent. Now between the genesis of the solar system and the history
 of civilisation there comes the vast process of organic evolution. The word
 development should be kept for the becoming of the individual, the chick out
 of the egg, for instance.</p>

 <p>Organic evolution is a continuous natural process of racial change, by
 successive steps in a definite direction, whereby distinctively new
 individualities arise, take root, and flourish, sometimes alongside of, and
 sometimes, sooner or later, in place of, the originative stock. Our
 domesticated breeds of pigeons and poultry are the results of evolutionary
 change whose origins are still with us in the Rock Dove and the Jungle Fowl;
 but in most cases in Wild Nature the ancestral stocks of present-day forms
 are long since extinct, and in many cases they are unknown. Evolution is a
 long process of coming and going, appearing and disappearing,<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> a long-drawn-out
 sublime process like a great piece of music.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Beginning of the Earth</h4>

 <p>When we speak the language of science we cannot say &quot;In the
 beginning,&quot; for we do not know of and cannot think of any condition of
 things that did not arise from something that went before. But we may qualify
 the phrase, and legitimately inquire into the beginning of the earth within
 the solar system. If the result of this inquiry is to trace the sun and the
 planets back to a nebula we reach only a relative beginning. The nebula has
 to be accounted for. And even before matter there may have been a
 pre-material world. If we say, as was said long ago, &quot;In the beginning
 was Mind,&quot; we may be expressing or trying to express a great truth, but
 we have gone <span class="smcap">BEYOND SCIENCE</span>.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Nebular Hypothesis</h4>

 <p>One of the grandest pictures that the scientific mind has ever thrown upon
 the screen is that of the Nebular Hypothesis. According to Laplace&#39;s
 famous form of this theory (1796), the solar system was once a gigantic
 glowing mass, spinning slowly and uniformly around its centre. As the
 incandescent world-cloud of gas cooled and its speed of rotation increased
 the shrinking mass gave off a separate whirling ring, which broke up and
 gathered together again as the first and most distant planet. The main mass
 gave off another ring and another till all the planets, including the earth,
 were formed. The central mass persisted as the sun.</p>

 <p>Laplace spoke of his theory, which Kant had anticipated forty-one years
 before, with scientific caution: &quot;conjectures which I present with all
 the distrust which everything not the result of observation or of calculation
 ought to inspire.&quot; Subsequent research justified his distrust, for it
 has been shown that the original nebula need not have been hot and need not
 have been gaseous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg
 58]</a></span> Moreover, there are great difficulties in Laplace&#39;s theory
 of the separation of successive rings from the main mass, and of the
 condensation of a whirling gaseous ring into a planet.</p>

 <p>So it has come about that the picture of a hot gaseous nebula revolving as
 a unit body has given place to other pictures. Thus Sir Norman Lockyer
 pointed out (1890) that the earth is gathering to itself millions of
 meteorites every day; this has been going on for millions of years; in
 distant ages the accretion may have been vastly more rapid and voluminous;
 and so the earth has grown! Now the meteoritic contributions are undoubted,
 but they require a centre to attract them, and the difficulty is to account
 for the beginning of a collecting centre or planetary nucleus. Moreover,
 meteorites are sporadic and erratic, scattered hither and thither rather than
 collecting into unit-bodies. As Professor Chamberlin says, &quot;meteorites
 have rather the characteristics of the wreckage of some earlier organisation
 than of the parentage of our planetary system.&quot; Several other theories
 have been propounded to account for the origin of the earth, but the one that
 has found most favour in the eyes of authorities is that of Chamberlin and
 Moulton. According to this theory a great nebular mass condensed to form the
 sun, from which under the attraction of passing stars planet after planet,
 the earth included, was heaved off in the form of knotted spiral nebulæ, like
 many of those now observed in the heavens.</p>

 <p>Of great importance were the &quot;knots,&quot; for they served as
 collecting centres drawing flying matter into their clutches. Whatever part
 of the primitive bolt escaped and scattered was drawn out into independent
 orbits round the sun, forming the &quot;planetesimals&quot; which behave like
 minute planets. These planetesimals formed the food on which the knots
 subsequently fed.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Growth of the Earth</h4>

 <p>It has been calculated that the newborn earth&mdash;the
 &quot;earth-knot&quot; of Chamberlin&#39;s theory&mdash;had a diameter of
 about 5,500<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg
 59]</a></span> miles. But it grew by drawing planetesimals into itself until
 it had a diameter of over 8,100 miles at the end of its growing period. Since
 then it has shrunk, by periodic shrinkages which have meant the buckling up
 of successive series of mountains, and it has now a diameter of 7,918 miles.
 But during the shrinking the earth became more varied.</p>

 <p>A sort of slow boiling of the internally hot earth often forced molten
 matter through the cold outer crust, and there came about a gradual
 assortment of lighter materials nearer the surface and heavier materials
 deeper down. The continents are built of the lighter materials, such as
 granites, while the beds of the great oceans are made of the heavier
 materials such as basalts. In limited areas land has often become sea, and
 sea has often given place to land, but the probability is that the
 distinction of the areas corresponding to the great continents and oceans
 goes back to a very early stage.</p>

 <p>The lithosphere is the more or less stable crust of the earth, which may
 have been, to begin with, about fifty miles in thickness. It seems that the
 young earth had no atmosphere, and that ages passed before water began to
 accumulate on its surface&mdash;before, in other words, there was any
 hydrosphere. The water came from the earth itself, to begin with, and it was
 long before there was any rain dissolving out saline matter from the exposed
 rocks and making the sea salt. The weathering of the high grounds of the
 ancient crust by air and water furnished the material which formed the
 sandstones and mudstones and other sedimentary rocks, which are said to
 amount to a thickness of over fifty miles in all.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 3</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Making a Home for Life</h4>

 <p>It is interesting to inquire how the callous, rough-and-tumble conditions
 of the outer world in early days were replaced by others that allowed of the
 germination and growth of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id=
 "Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> tender plant we call LIFE. There are very tough
 living creatures, but the average organism is ill suited for violence. Most
 living creatures are adapted to mild temperatures and gentle reactions. Hence
 the fundamental importance of the early atmosphere, heavy with planetesimal
 dust, in blanketing the earth against intensities of radiance from without,
 as Chamberlin says, and inequalities of radiance from within. This was the
 first preparation for life, but it was an atmosphere without free oxygen. Not
 less important was the appearance of pools and lakelets, of lakes and seas.
 Perhaps the early waters covered the earth. And water was the second
 preparation for life&mdash;water, that can dissolve a larger variety of
 substances in greater concentration than any other liquid; water, that in
 summer does not readily evaporate altogether from a pond, nor in winter
 freeze throughout its whole extent; water, that is such a mobile vehicle and
 such a subtle cleaver of substances; water, that forms over 80 per cent. of
 living matter itself.</p>

 <p>Of great significance was the abundance of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
 (in the form of carbonic acid and water) in the atmosphere of the cooling
 earth, for these three wonderful elements have a unique <i>ensemble</i> of
 properties&mdash;ready to enter into reactions and relations, making great
 diversity and complexity possible, favouring the formation of the plastic and
 permeable materials that build up living creatures. We must not pursue the
 idea, but it is clear that the stones and mortar of the inanimate world are
 such that they built a friendly home for life.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Origin of Living Creatures upon the Earth</h4>

 <p>During the early chapters of the earth&#39;s history, no living creature
 that we can imagine could possibly have lived there. The temperature was too
 high; there was neither atmosphere nor surface water. Therefore it follows
 that at some uncertain, but inconceivably distant date, living creatures
 appeared upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg
 61]</a></span> the earth. No one knows how, but it is interesting to consider
 possibilities.</p>

   commonly found gliding on the mud or weeds in ponds, where it engulfs its

   contains ingested food. From the contractile vacuole (CV) the waste matter

 <p>From ancient times it has been a favourite answer that the dust of the
 earth may have become living in a way which is outside scientific
 description. This answer forecloses the question, and it is far too soon to
 do that. Science must often say &quot;Ignoramus&quot;: Science should be slow
 to say &quot;Ignorabimus.&quot;</p>

 <p>A second position held by Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin, and others, suggests
 that minute living creatures may have come to the earth from elsewhere, in
 the cracks of a meteorite or among cosmic dust. It must be remembered that
 seeds can survive prolonged exposure to very low temperatures; that spores of
 bacteria can survive high temperature; that seeds of plants and germs of
 animals in a state of &quot;latent life&quot; can survive prolonged drought
 and absence of oxygen. It is possible, according to Berthelot, that as long
 as there is not molecular disintegration vital activities may be suspended
 for a time, and may afterwards recommence when appropriate conditions are
 restored. Therefore, one should be slow to say that a long journey through
 space is impossible. The obvious limitation of Lord Kelvin&#39;s theory is
 that it only shifts the problem of the origin of organisms (i.e. living
 creatures) from the earth to elsewhere.</p>

 <p>The third answer is that living creatures of a very simple sort may have
 emerged on the earth&#39;s surface from not-living material, e.g. from some
 semi-fluid carbon compounds activated by ferments. The tenability of this
 view is suggested by the achievements of the synthetic chemists, who are able
 artificially to build up substances such as oxalic acid, indigo, salicylic
 acid, caffeine, and grape-sugar. We do not know, indeed, what in Nature&#39;s
 laboratory would take the place of the clever synthetic chemist, but there
 seems to be a tendency to complexity. Corpuscles form atoms, atoms form
 molecules, small molecules large ones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62"
 id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

 <p>Various concrete suggestions have been made in regard to the possible
 origin of living matter, which will be dealt with in a later chapter. So far
 as we know of what goes on to-day, there is no evidence of spontaneous
 generation; organisms seem always to arise from pre-existing organisms of the
 same kind; where any suggestion of the contrary has been fancied, there have
 been flaws in the experimenting. But it is one thing to accept the verdict
 &quot;omne vivum e vivo&quot; as a fact to which experiment has not yet
 discovered an exception and another thing to maintain that this must always
 have been true or must always remain true.</p>

 <p>If the synthetic chemists should go on surpassing themselves, if
 substances like white of egg should be made artificially, and if we should
 get more light on possible steps by which simple living creatures may have
 arisen from not-living materials, this would not greatly affect our general
 outlook on life, though it would increase our appreciation of what is often
 libelled as &quot;inert&quot; matter. If the dust of the earth did naturally
 give rise very long ago to living creatures, if they are in a real sense born
 of her and of the sunshine, then the whole world becomes more continuous and
 more vital, and all the inorganic groaning and travailing becomes more
 intelligible.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 4</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The First Organisms upon the Earth</h4>

 <p>We cannot have more than a speculative picture of the first living
 creatures upon the earth or, rather, in the waters that covered the earth. A
 basis for speculation is to be found, however, in the simplest creatures
 living to-day, such as some of the bacteria and one-celled animalcules,
 especially those called Protists, which have not taken any very definite step
 towards becoming either plants or animals. No one can be sure, but there is
 much to be said for the theory that the first creatures were<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> microscopic
 globules of living matter, not unlike the simplest bacteria of to-day, but
 able to live on air, water, and dissolved salts. From such a source may have
 originated a race of one-celled marine organisms which were able to
 manufacture chlorophyll, or something like chlorophyll, that is to say, the
 green pigment which makes it possible for plants to utilise the energy of the
 sunlight in breaking up carbon dioxide and in building up (photosynthesis)
 carbon compounds like sugars and starch. These little units were probably
 encased in a cell-wall of cellulose, but their boxed-in energy expressed
 itself in the undulatory movement of a lash or flagellum, by means of which
 they propelled themselves energetically through the water. There are many
 similar organisms to-day, mostly in water, but some of them&mdash;simple
 one-celled plants&mdash;paint the tree-stems and even the paving-stones green
 in wet weather. According to Prof. A. H. Church there was a long chapter in
 the history of the earth when the sea that covered everything teemed with
 these green flagellates&mdash;the originators of the Vegetable Kingdom.</p>

 <p>On another tack, however, there probably evolved a series of simple
 predatory creatures, not able to build up organic matter from air, water, and
 salts, but devouring their neighbours. These units were not closed in with
 cellulose, but remained naked, with their living matter or protoplasm flowing
 out in changeful processes, such as we see in the Am&oelig;bæ in the ditch or
 in our own white blood corpuscles and other am&oelig;boid cells. These were
 the originators of the animal kingdom. Thus from very simple Protists the
 first animals and the first plants may have arisen. All were still very
 minute, and it is worth remembering that had there been any scientific
 spectator after our kind upon the earth during these long ages, he would have
 lamented the entire absence of life, although the seas were teeming. The
 simplest forms of life and the protoplasm which Huxley called the physical
 basis of life will be dealt with in the chapter on Biology in a later section
 of this work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg

 BODIES&mdash;EVOLUTION OF SEX&mdash;BEGINNING OF NATURAL DEATH</h4>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Contrast between Plants and Animals</h4>

 <p>However it may have come about, there is no doubt at all that one of the
 first great steps in Organic Evolution was the forking of the genealogical
 tree into Plants and Animals&mdash;the most important parting of the ways in
 the whole history of Nature.</p>

 <p>Typical plants have chlorophyll; they are able to feed at a low chemical
 level on air, water, and salts, using the energy of the sunlight in their
 photosynthesis. They have their cells boxed in by cellulose walls, so that
 their opportunities for motility are greatly restricted. They manufacture
 much more nutritive material than they need, and live far below their income.
 They have no ready way of getting rid of any nitrogenous waste matter that
 they may form, and this probably helps to keep them sluggish.</p>

 <p>Animals, on the other hand, feed at a high chemical level, on the
 carbohydrates (e.g. starch and sugar), fats, and proteins (e.g. gluten,
 albumin, casein) which are manufactured by other animals, or to begin with,
 by plants. Their cells have not cellulose walls, nor in most cases much wall
 of any kind, and motility in the majority is unrestricted. Animals live much
 more nearly up to their income. If we could make for an animal and a plant of
 equal weight two fractions showing the ratio of the upbuilding, constructive,
 chemical processes to the down-breaking, disruptive, chemical processes that
 go on in their respective bodies, the ratio for the plant would be much
 greater than the corresponding ratio for the animal. In other words, animals
 take the munitions which plants laboriously manufacture and explode them in
 locomotion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg
 65]</a></span> and work; and the entire system of animate nature depends upon
 the photosynthesis that goes on in green plants.</p>

 <p>As the result of much more explosive life, animals have to deal with much
 in the way of nitrogenous waste products, the ashes of the living fire, but
 these are usually got rid of very effectively, e.g. in the kidney filters,
 and do not clog the system by being deposited as crystals and the like, as
 happens in plants. Sluggish animals like sea-squirts which have no kidneys
 are exceptions that prove the rule, and it need hardly be said that the
 statements that have been made in regard to the contrasts between plants and
 animals are general statements. There is often a good deal of the plant about
 the animal, as in sedentary sponges, zoophytes, corals, and sea-squirts, and
 there is often a little of the animal about the plant, as we see in the
 movements of all shoots and roots and leaves, and occasionally in the parts
 of the flower. But the important fact is that on the early forking of the
 genealogical tree, i.e. the divergence of plants and animals, there depended
 and depends all the higher life of the animal kingdom, not to speak of
 mankind. The continuance of civilisation, the upkeep of the human and animal
 population of the globe, and even the supply of oxygen to the air we breathe,
 depend on the silent laboratories of the green leaves, which are able with
 the help of the sunlight to use carbonic acid, water, and salts to build up
 the bread of life.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Beginnings of Land Plants</h4>

 <p>It is highly probable that for long ages the waters covered the earth, and
 that all the primeval vegetation consisted of simple Flagellates in the
 universal Open Sea. But contraction of the earth&#39;s crust brought about
 elevations and depressions of the sea-floor, and in places the solid
 substratum was brought near enough the surface to allow the floating plants
 to begin to settle down without getting out of the light. This is how
 Professor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg
 66]</a></span> Church pictures the beginning of a fixed vegetation&mdash;a
 very momentous step in evolution. It was perhaps among this early vegetation
 that animals had their first successes. As the floor of the sea in these
 shallow areas was raised higher and higher there was a beginning of dry land.
 The sedentary plants already spoken of were the ancestors of the shore
 seaweeds, and there is no doubt that when we go down at the lowest tide and
 wade cautiously out among the jungle of vegetation only exposed on such
 occasions we are getting a glimpse of very ancient days. <i>This</i> is the
 forest primeval.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Protozoa</h4>

 <p>Animals below the level of zoophytes and sponges are called Protozoa. The
 word obviously means &quot;First Animals,&quot; but all that we can say is
 that the very simplest of them may give us some hint of the simplicity of the
 original first animals. For it is quite certain that the vast majority of the
 Protozoa to-day are far too complicated to be thought of as primitive. Though
 most of them are microscopic, each is an animal complete in itself, with the
 same fundamental bodily attributes as are manifested in ourselves. They
 differ from animals of higher degree in not being built up of the unit areas
 or corpuscles called cells. They have no cells, no tissues, no organs, in the
 ordinary acceptation of these words, but many of them show a great complexity
 of internal structure, far exceeding that of the ordinary cells that build up
 the tissues of higher animals. They are complete living creatures which have
 not gone in for body-making.</p>

 <p>In the dim and distant past there was a time when the only animals were of
 the nature of Protozoa, and it is safe to say that one of the great steps in
 evolution was the establishment of three great types of Protozoa: (<i>a</i>)
 Some were very active, the Infusorians, like the slipper animalcule, the
 night-light (Noctiluca), which makes the seas phosphorescent at night, and
 the deadly Trypanosome, which causes Sleeping Sickness.<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> (<i>b</i>) Others
 were very sluggish, the parasitic Sporozoa, like the malaria organism which
 the mosquito introduces into man&#39;s body. (<i>c</i>) Others were neither
 very active nor very passive, the Rhizopods, with out-flowing processes of
 living matter. This am&oelig;boid line of evolution has been very successful;
 it is represented by the Rhizopods, such as Am&oelig;bæ and the chalk-forming
 Foraminifera and the exquisitely beautiful flint-shelled Radiolarians of the
 open sea. They have their counterparts in the am&oelig;boid cells of most
 multicellular animals, such as the phagocytes which migrate about in the
 body, engulfing and digesting intruding bacteria, serving as sappers and
 miners when something has to be broken down and built up again, and
 performing other useful offices.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 3</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Making of a Body</h4>

 <p>The great naturalist Louis Agassiz once said that the biggest gulf in
 Organic Nature was that between the unicellular and the multicellular animals
 (Protozoa and Metazoa). But the gulf was bridged very long ago when sponges,
 stinging animals, and simple worms were evolved, and showed, for the first
 time, a &quot;body.&quot; What would one not give to be able to account for
 the making of a body, one of the great steps in evolution! No one knows, but
 the problem is not altogether obscure.</p>

 <p>When an ordinary Protozoon or one-celled animal divides into two or more,
 which is its way of multiplying, the daughter-units thus formed float apart
 and live independent lives. But there are a few Protozoa in which the
 daughter-units are not quite separated off from one another, but remain
 coherent. Thus Volvox, a beautiful green ball, found in some canals and the
 like, is a colony of a thousand or even ten thousand cells. It has almost
 formed a body! But in this &quot;colony-making&quot; Protozoon, and in others
 like it, the component cells are all of one kind, whereas in true
 multicellular animals there are different kinds of<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> cells, showing
 division of labour. There are some other Protozoa in which the nucleus or
 kernel divides into many nuclei within the cell. This is seen in the Giant
 Am&oelig;ba (Pelomyxa), sometimes found in duck-ponds, or the beautiful
 Opalina, which always lives in the hind part of the frog&#39;s food-canal. If
 a portion of the living matter of these Protozoa should gather round each of
 the nuclei, then <i>that would be the beginning of a body</i>. It would be
 still nearer the beginning of a body if division of labour set in, and if
 there was a setting apart of egg-cells and sperm-cells distinct from
 body-cells.</p>

 <p>It was possibly in some such way that animals and plants with a body were
 first evolved. Two points should be noticed, that body-making is not
 essentially a matter of size, though it made large size possible. For the
 body of a many-celled Wheel Animalcule or Rotifer is no bigger than many a
 Protozoon. Yet the Rotifer&mdash;we are thinking of Hydatina&mdash;has nine
 hundred odd cells, whereas the Protozoon has only one, except in forms like
 Volvox. Secondly, it is a luminous fact that <i>every many-celled animal from
 sponge to man that multiplies in the ordinary way begins at the beginning
 again as a &quot;single cell,&quot;</i> the fertilised egg-cell. It is, of
 course, not an ordinary single cell that develops into an earthworm or a
 butterfly, an eagle, or a man; it is a cell in which a rich inheritance, the
 fruition of ages, is somehow condensed; but it is interesting to bear in mind
 the elementary fact that every many-celled creature, reproduced in the
 ordinary way and not by budding or the like, starts as a fertilised egg-cell.
 The coherence of the daughter-cells into which the fertilised egg-cell
 divides is a reminiscence, as it were, of the primeval coherence of
 daughter-units that made the first body possible.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Beginning of Sexual Reproduction</h4>

 <p>A freshwater Hydra, growing on the duckweed usually multiplies by budding.
 It forms daughter-buds, living images of itself; a check comes to nutrition
 and these daughter-buds go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id=
 "Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> free. A big sea-anemone may divide in two or
 more parts, which become separate animals. This is asexual reproduction,
 which means that the multiplication takes place by dividing into two or many
 portions, and not by liberating egg-cells and sperm-cells. Among animals as
 among plants, asexual reproduction is very common. But it has great
 disadvantages, for it is apt to be physiologically expensive, and it is beset
 with difficulties when the body shows great division of labour, and is very
 intimately bound into unity. Thus, no one can think of a bee or a bird
 multiplying by division or by budding. Moreover, if the body of the parent
 has suffered from injury or deterioration, the result of this is bound to be
 handed on to the next generation if asexual reproduction is the only
 method.</p>

  </div>
 </div>

 <p>Splitting into two or many parts was the old-fashioned way of multiplying,
 but one of the great steps in evolution was the discovery of a better method,
 namely, sexual reproduction. The gist of this is simply that during the
 process of body-building (by the development of the fertilised egg-cell)
 certain units, <i>the germ-cells</i>, do not share in forming ordinary
 tissues or organs, but remain apart, continuing the full inheritance which
 was condensed in the fertilised egg-cell. <i>These cells kept by themselves
 are the originators of the future reproductive cells of the mature
 animal</i>; they give rise to the egg-cells and the sperm-cells.</p>

 <p>The advantages of this method are great. (1) The new generation is started
 less expensively, for it is easier to shed germ-cells into the cradle of the
 water than to separate off half of the body. (2) It is possible to start a
 great many new lives at once, and this may be of vital importance when the
 struggle for existence is very keen, and when parental care is impossible.
 (3) The germ-cells are little likely to be prejudicially affected by
 disadvantageous dints impressed on the body of the parent&mdash;little likely
 unless the dints have peculiarly penetrating consequences, as in the case of
 poisons. (4) A further advantage is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70"
 id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> implied in the formation of two kinds of
 germ-cells&mdash;the ovum or egg-cell, with a considerable amount of building
 material and often with a legacy of nutritive yolk; the spermatozoon or
 sperm-cell, adapted to move in fluids and to find the ovum from a distance,
 thus securing change-provoking cross-fertilisation.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 4</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Evolution of Sex</h4>

 <p>Another of the great steps in organic evolution was the differentiation of
 two different physiological types, the male or sperm-producer and the female
 or egg-producer. It seems to be a deep-seated difference in constitution,
 which leads one egg to develop into a male, and another, lying beside it in
 the nest, into a female. In the case of pigeons it seems almost certain, from
 the work of Professor Oscar Riddle, that there are two kinds of egg, a
 male-producing egg and a female-producing egg, which differ in their
 yolk-forming and other physiological characters.</p>

 <p>In sea-urchins we often find two creatures superficially
 indistinguishable, but the one is a female with large ovaries and the other
 is a male with equally large testes. Here the physiological difference does
 not affect the body as a whole, but the reproductive organs or gonads only,
 though more intimate physiology would doubtless discover differences in the
 blood or in the chemical routine (metabolism). In a large number of cases,
 however, there are marked superficial differences between the sexes, and
 everyone is familiar with such contrasts as peacock and peahen, stag and
 hind. In such cases the physiological difference between the sperm-producer
 and the ovum-producer, for this is the essential difference, saturates
 through the body and expresses itself in masculine and feminine structures
 and modes of behaviour. The expression of the masculine and feminine
 characters is in some cases under the control of hormones or chemical
 messengers which are carried by the blood from the reproductive organs
 throughout the body, and pull the trigger which brings<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> about the
 development of an antler or a wattle or a decorative plume or a capacity for
 vocal and saltatory display. In some cases it is certain that the female
 carries in a latent state the masculine features, but these are kept from
 expressing themselves by other chemical messengers from the ovary. Of these
 chemical messengers more must be said later on.</p>

 <p>Recent research has shown that while the difference between male and
 female is very deep-rooted, corresponding to a difference in gearing, it is
 not always clear-cut. Thus a hen-pigeon may be very masculine, and a
 cock-pigeon very feminine. The difference is in degree, not in kind.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 5</h3>

 <p>What is the meaning of the universal or almost universal inevitableness of
 death? A Sequoia or &quot;Big Tree&quot; of California has been known to live
 for over two thousand years, but eventually it died. A centenarian tortoise
 has been known, and a sea-anemone sixty years of age; but eventually they
 die. What is the meaning of this apparently inevitable stoppage of bodily
 life?</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Beginning of Natural Death</h4>

 <p>There are three chief kinds of death, (<i>a</i>) The great majority of
 animals come to a violent end, being devoured by others or killed by sudden
 and extreme changes in their surroundings. (<i>b</i>) When an animal enters a
 new habitat, or comes into new associations with other organisms, it may be
 invaded by a microbe or by some larger parasite to which it is unaccustomed
 and to which it can offer no resistance. With many parasites a
 &quot;live-and-let-live&quot; compromise is arrived at, but new parasites are
 apt to be fatal, as man knows to his cost when he is bitten by a tse-tse fly
 which infects him with the microscopic animal (a Trypanosome) that causes
 Sleeping Sickness. In many animals the parasites are not troublesome as long
 as the host is vigorous,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id=
 "Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> but if the host is out of condition the
 parasites may get the upper hand, as in the so-called &quot;grouse
 disease,&quot; and become fatal. (<i>c</i>) But besides violent death and
 microbic (or parasitic) death, there is natural death. This is in great part
 to be regarded as the price paid for a body. A body worth having implies
 complexity or division of labour, and this implies certain internal
 furnishings of a more or less stable kind in which the effects of wear and
 tear are apt to accumulate. It is not the living matter itself that grows old
 so much as the framework in which it works&mdash;the furnishings of the vital
 laboratory. There are various processes of rejuvenescence, e.g. rest, repair,
 change, reorganisation, which work against the inevitable processes of
 senescence, but sooner or later the victory is with ageing. Another deep
 reason for natural death is to be found in the physiological expensiveness of
 reproduction, for many animals, from worms to eels, illustrate natural death
 as the nemesis of starting new lives. Now it is a very striking fact that to
 a large degree the simplest animals or Protozoa are exempt from natural
 death. They are so relatively simple that they can continually recuperate by
 rest and repair; they do not accumulate any bad debts. Moreover, their modes
 of multiplying, by dividing into two or many units, are very inexpensive
 physiologically. It seems that in some measure this bodily immortality of the
 Protozoa is shared by some simple many-celled animals like the freshwater
 Hydra and Planarian worms. Here is an interesting chapter in evolution, the
 evolution of means of evading or staving off natural death. Thus there is the
 well-known case of the Paloloworm of the coral-reefs where the body breaks up
 in liberating the germ-cells, but the head-end remains fixed in a crevice of
 the coral, and buds out a new body at leisure.</p>

 <p>Along with the evolution of the ways of avoiding death should be
 considered also the gradual establishment of the length of life best suited
 to the welfare of the species, and the punctuation of the life-history to
 suit various conditions.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 6</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Great Acquisitions</h4>

 <p>In animals like sea-anemones and jellyfishes the general symmetry of the
 body is radial; that is to say, there is no right or left, and the body might
 be halved along many planes. It is a kind of symmetry well suited for
 sedentary or for drifting life. But worms began the profitable habit of
 moving with one end of the body always in front, and from worms to man the
 great majority of animals have bilateral symmetry. They have a right and a
 left side, and there is only one cut that halves the body. This kind of
 symmetry is suited for a more strenuous life than radial animals show; it is
 suited for pursuing food, for avoiding enemies, for chasing mates. And
 <i>with the establishment of bilateral symmetry must be associated the
 establishment of head-brains</i>, the beginning of which is to be found in
 some simple worm-types.</p>

 <p>Among the other great acquisitions gradually evolved we may notice: a
 well-developed head with sense-organs, the establishment of large internal
 surfaces such as the digestive and absorptive wall of the food-canal, the
 origin of quickly contracting striped muscle and of muscular appendages, the
 formation of blood as a distributing medium throughout the body, from which
 all the parts take what they need and to which they also contribute.</p>

 <p>Another very important acquisition, almost confined (so far as is known)
 to backboned animals, was the evolution of what are called glands of internal
 secretion, such as the thyroid and the supra-renal. These manufacture subtle
 chemical substances which are distributed by the blood throughout the body,
 and have a manifold influence in regulating and harmonising the vital
 processes. Some of these chemical messengers are called hormones, which
 stimulate organs and tissues to greater activity; others are called chalones,
 which put on a brake. Some regulate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74"
 id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> growth and others rapidly alter the pressure
 and composition of the blood. Some of them call into active development
 certain parts of the body which have been, as it were, waiting for an
 appropriate trigger-pulling. Thus, at the proper time, the milk-glands of a
 mammalian mother are awakened from their dormancy. This very interesting
 outcome of evolution will be dealt with in another portion of this work.</p>

 <h3>THE INCLINED PLANE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <p>Before passing to a connected story of the gradual emergence of higher and
 higher forms of life in the course of the successive ages&mdash;the
 procession of life, as it may be called&mdash;it will be useful to consider
 the evolution of animal behaviour.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Evolution of Mind</h4>

 <p>A human being begins as a microscopic fertilised egg-cell, within which
 there is condensed the long result of time&mdash;Man&#39;s inheritance. The
 long period of nine months before birth, with its intimate partnership
 between mother and offspring, is passed as it were in sleep, and no one can
 make any statement in regard to the mind of the unborn child. Even after
 birth the dawn of mind is as slow as it is wonderful. To begin with, there is
 in the ovum and early embryo no nervous system at all, and it develops very
 gradually from simple beginnings. Yet as mentality cannot come in from
 outside, we seem bound to conclude that the potentiality of it&mdash;whatever
 that means&mdash;resides in the individual from the very first. The
 particular kind of activity known to us as thinking, feeling, and willing is
 the most intimate part of our experience, known to us directly apart from our
 senses, and the possibility of that must be implicit in the germ-cell just as
 the genius of Newton was implicit in a very miserable specimen of an infant.
 Now what is true of the individual is true also of the race&mdash;there is a
 gradual evolution of that aspect of the living<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> creature&#39;s activity which we
 call mind. We cannot put our finger on any point and say: Before this stage
 there was no mind. Indeed, many facts suggest the conclusion that wherever
 there is life there is some degree of mind&mdash;even in the plants. Or it
 might be more accurate to put the conclusion in another way, that the
 activity we call life has always in some degree an inner or mental
 aspect.</p>

   <p>OKAPI AND GIRAFFE</p>

   <p class="wide">The Okapi is one of the great zoölogical discoveries. It
   gives a good idea of what the Giraffe&#39;s ancestors were like. The Okapi
   was unknown until discovered in 1900 by Sir Harry Johnston in Central
   Africa, where these strange animals have probably lived in dense forests
   from time immemorial.</p>
  </div>
 </div>

 <p>In another part of this book there is an account of the dawn of mind in
 backboned animals; what we aim at here is an outline of what may be called
 the inclined plane of animal behaviour.</p>

 <p>A very simple animal accumulates a little store of potential energy, and
 it proceeds to expend this, like an explosive, by acting on its environment.
 It does so in a very characteristic self-preservative fashion, so that it
 burns without being consumed and explodes without being blown to bits. It is
 characteristic of the organism that it remains a going concern for a longer
 or shorter period&mdash;its length of life. Living creatures that expended
 their energy ineffectively or self-destructively would be eliminated in the
 struggle for existence. When a simple one-celled organism explores a corner
 of the field seen under a microscope, behaving to all appearance very like a
 dog scouring a field seen through a telescope, it seems permissible to think
 of something corresponding to mental endeavour associated with its activity.
 This impression is strengthened when an am&oelig;ba pursues another
 am&oelig;ba, overtakes it, engulfs it, loses it, pursues it again, recaptures
 it, and so on. What is quite certain is that the behaviour of the animalcule
 is not like that of a potassium pill fizzing about in a basin of water, nor
 like the lurching movements of a gun that has got loose and &quot;taken
 charge&quot; on board ship. Another feature is that the locomotor activity of
 an animalcule often shows a distinct individuality: it may swim, for
 instance, in a loose spiral.</p>

 <p>But there is another side to vital activity besides acting
 upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
 the surrounding world; the living creature is acted on by influences from
 without. The organism acts on its environment; that is the one side of the
 shield: the environment acts upon the organism; that is the other side. If we
 are to see life whole we must recognise these two sides of what we call
 living, and it is missing an important part of the history of animal life if
 we fail to see that evolution implies becoming more advantageously sensitive
 to the environment, making more of its influences, shutting out profitless
 stimuli, and opening more gateways to knowledge. The bird&#39;s world is a
 larger and finer world than an earthworm&#39;s; the world means more to the
 bird than to the worm.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Trial and Error Method</h4>

 <p>Simple creatures act with a certain degree of spontaneity on their
 environment, and they likewise react effectively to surrounding stimuli.
 Animals come to have definite &quot;answers back,&quot; sometimes several,
 sometimes only one, as in the case of the Slipper Animalcule, which reverses
 its cilia when it comes within the sphere of some disturbing influence,
 retreats, and, turning upon itself tentatively, sets off again in the same
 general direction as before, but at an angle to the previous line. If it
 misses the disturbing influence, well and good; if it strikes it again, the
 tactics are repeated until a satisfactory way out is discovered or the
 stimulation proves fatal.</p>

 <p>It may be said that the Slipper Animalcule has but one answer to every
 question, but there are many Protozoa which have several enregistered
 reactions. When there are alternative reactions which are tried one after
 another, the animal is pursuing what is called the trial-and-error method,
 and a higher note is struck.</p>

 <p>There is an endeavour after satisfaction, and a trial of answers. When the
 creature profits by experience to the extent of giving the right answer
 first, there is the beginning of learning.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Reflex Actions</h4>

 <p>Among simple multicellular animals, such as sea-anemones, we find the
 beginnings of reflex actions, and a considerable part of the behaviour of the
 lower animals is reflex. That is to say, there are laid down in the animal in
 the course of its development certain pre-arrangements of nerve-cells and
 muscle-cells which secure that a fit and proper answer is given to a
 frequently recurrent stimulus. An earthworm half out of its burrow becomes
 aware of the light tread of a thrush&#39;s foot, and jerks itself back into
 its hole before anyone can say &quot;reflex action.&quot; What is it that
 happens?</p>

 <p>Certain sensory nerve-cells in the earthworm&#39;s skin are stimulated by
 vibrations in the earth; the message travels down a sensory nerve-fibre from
 each of the stimulated cells and enters the nerve-cord. The sensory fibres
 come into vital connection with branches of intermediary, associative, or
 communicating cells, which are likewise connected with motor nerve-cells. To
 these the message is thus shunted. From the motor nerve-cells an impulse or
 command travels by motor nerve-fibres, one from each cell, to the muscles,
 which contract. If this took as long to happen as it takes to describe, even
 in outline, it would not be of much use to the earthworm. But the motor
 answer follows the sensory stimulus almost instantaneously. The great
 advantage of establishing or enregistering these reflex chains is that the
 answers are practically ready-made or inborn, not requiring to be learned. It
 is not necessary that the brain should be stimulated if there is a brain; nor
 does the animal will to act, though in certain cases it may by means of
 higher controlling nerve-centres keep the natural reflex response from being
 given, as happens, for instance, when we control a cough or a sneeze on some
 solemn occasion. The evolutionary method, if we may use the expression, has
 been to enregister ready-made responses; and as we ascend the animal kingdom,
 we find reflex actions becoming complicated and often linked together, so
 that the occurrence of one pulls the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78"
 id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> trigger of another, and so on in a chain. The
 behaviour of the insectivorous plant called Venus&#39;s fly-trap when it
 shuts on an insect is like a reflex action in an animal, but plants have no
 definite nervous system.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">What are Called Tropisms</h4>

 <p>A somewhat higher level on the inclined plane is illustrated by what are
 called &quot;tropisms,&quot; obligatory movements which the animal makes,
 adjusting its whole body so that physiological equilibrium results in
 relation to gravity, pressure, currents, moisture, heat, light, electricity,
 and surfaces of contact. A moth is flying past a candle; the eye next the
 light is more illumined than the other; a physiological inequilibrium
 results, affecting nerve-cells and muscle-cells; the outcome is that the moth
 automatically adjusts its flight so that both eyes become equally illumined;
 in doing this it often flies into the candle.</p>

 <p>It may seem bad business that the moth should fly into the candle, but the
 flame is an utterly artificial item in its environment to which no one can
 expect it to be adapted. These tropisms play an important rôle in animal
 behaviour.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Instinctive Behaviour</h4>

 <p>On a higher level is instinctive behaviour, which reaches such remarkable
 perfection in ants, bees, and wasps. In its typical expression instinctive
 behaviour depends on inborn capacities; it does not require to be learned; it
 is independent of practice or experience, though it may be improved by both;
 it is shared equally by all members of the species of the same sex (for the
 female&#39;s instincts are often different from the male&#39;s); it refers to
 particular conditions of life that are of vital importance, though they may
 occur only once in a lifetime. The female Yucca Moth emerges from the cocoon
 when the Yucca flower puts forth its bell-like blossoms. She flies to a
 flower, collects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg
 79]</a></span> some pollen from the stamens, kneads it into a pill-like ball,
 and stows this away under her chin. She flies to an older Yucca flower and
 lays her eggs in some of the ovules within the seed-box, but before she does
 so she has to deposit on the stigma the ball of pollen. From this the
 pollen-tubes grow down and the pollen-nucleus of a tube fertilises the
 egg-cell in an ovule, so that the possible seeds become real seeds, for it is
 only a fraction of them that the Yucca Moth has destroyed by using them as
 cradles for her eggs. Now it is plain that the Yucca Moth has no individual
 experience of Yucca flowers, yet she secures the continuance of her race by a
 concatenation of actions which form part of her instinctive repertory.</p>

 <p>From a physiological point of view instinctive behaviour is like a chain
 of compound reflex actions, but in some cases, at least, there is reason to
 believe that the behaviour is suffused with awareness and backed by
 endeavour. This is suggested in exceptional cases where the stereotyped
 routine is departed from to meet exceptional conditions. It should also be
 noted that just as ants, hive bees, and wasps exhibit in most cases purely
 instinctive behaviour, but move on occasion on the main line of trial and
 error or of experimental initiative, so among birds and mammals the
 intelligent behaviour is sometimes replaced by instinctive routine. Perhaps
 there is no instinctive behaviour without a spice of intelligence, and no
 intelligent behaviour without an instinctive element. The old view that
 instinctive behaviour was originally intelligent, and that instinct is
 &quot;lapsed intelligence,&quot; is a tempting one, and is suggested by the
 way in which habitual intelligent actions cease in the individual to require
 intelligent control, but it rests on the unproved hypothesis that the
 acquisitions of the individual can be entailed on the race. It is almost
 certain that instinct is on a line of evolution quite different from
 intelligence, and that it is nearer to the inborn inspirations of the
 calculating boy or the musical genius than to the plodding methods of
 intelligent learning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg

 <h4 class="sect">Animal Intelligence</h4>

 <p>The higher reaches of the inclined plane of behaviour show intelligence in
 the strict sense. They include those kinds of behaviour which cannot be
 described without the suggestion that the animal makes some sort of
 perceptual inference, not only profiting by experience but learning by ideas.
 Such intelligent actions show great individual variability; they are plastic
 and adjustable in a manner rarely hinted at in connection with instincts
 where routine cannot be departed from without the creature being nonplussed;
 they are not bound up with particular circumstances as instinctive actions
 are, but imply an appreciative awareness of relations.</p>

 <p>When there is an experimenting with general ideas, when there is
 <i>conceptual</i> as contrasted with <i>perceptual</i> inference, we speak of
 Reason, but there is no evidence of this below the level of man. It is not,
 indeed, always that we can credit man with rational conduct, but he has the
 possibility of it ever within his reach.</p>

 <p>Animal instinct and intelligence will be illustrated in another part of
 this work. We are here concerned simply with the general question of the
 evolution of behaviour. There is a main line of tentative experimental
 behaviour both below and above the level of intelligence, and it has been
 part of the tactics of evolution to bring about the hereditary enregistration
 of capacities of effective response, the advantages being that the answers
 come more rapidly and that the creature is left free, if it chooses, for
 higher adventures.</p>

 <p>There is no doubt as to the big fact that in the course of evolution
 animals have shown an increasing complexity and masterfulness of behaviour,
 that they have become at once more controlled and more definitely free
 agents, and that the inner aspect of the behaviour&mdash;experimenting,
 learning, thinking, feeling, and willing&mdash;has come to count for more and
 more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg

 <h3 class="dim">§ 3</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Evolution of Parental Care</h4>

 <p>Mammals furnish a crowning instance of a trend of evolution which
 expresses itself at many levels&mdash;the tendency to bring forth the young
 at a well-advanced stage and to an increase of parental care associated with
 a decrease in the number of offspring. There is a British starfish called
 <i>Luidia</i> which has two hundred millions of eggs in a year, and there are
 said to be several millions of eggs in conger-eels and some other fishes.
 These illustrate the spawning method of solving the problem of survival. Some
 animals are naturally prolific, and the number of eggs which they sow
 broadcast in the waters allows for enormous infantile mortality and obviates
 any necessity for parental care.</p>

 <p>But some other creatures, by nature less prolific, have found an entirely
 different solution of the problem. They practise parental care and they
 secure survival with greatly economised reproduction. This is a trend of
 evolution particularly characteristic of the higher animals. So much so that
 Herbert Spencer formulated the generalisation that the size and frequency of
 the animal family is inverse ratio to the degree of evolution to which the
 animal has attained.</p>

 <p>Now there are many different methods of parental care which secure the
 safety of the young, and one of these is called viviparity. The young ones
 are not liberated from the parent until they are relatively well advanced and
 more or less able to look after themselves. This gives the young a good
 send-off in life, and their chances of death are greatly reduced. In other
 words, the animals that have varied in the direction of economised
 reproduction may keep their foothold in the struggle for existence if they
 have varied at the same time in the direction of parental care. In other
 cases it may have worked the other way round.</p>

 <p>In the interesting archaic animal called <i>Peripatus</i>, which
 has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> to
 face a modern world too severe for it, one of the methods of meeting the
 environing difficulties is the retention of the offspring for many months
 within the mother, so that it is born a fully-formed creature. There are only
 a few offspring at a time, and, although there are exceptional cases like the
 summer green-flies, which are very prolific though viviparous, the general
 rule is that viviparity is associated with a very small family. The case of
 flowering plants stands by itself, for although they illustrate a kind of
 viviparity, the seed being embryos, an individual plant may have a large
 number of flowers and therefore a huge family.</p>

 <p>Viviparity naturally finds its best illustrations among terrestrial
 animals, where the risks to the young life are many, and it finds its climax
 among mammals.</p>

 <p>Now it is an interesting fact that the three lowest mammals, the Duckmole
 and two Spiny Ant-eaters, lay eggs, i.e. are oviparous; that the Marsupials,
 on the next grade, bring forth their young, as it were, prematurely, and in
 most cases stow them away in an external pouch; while all the
 others&mdash;the Placentals&mdash;show a more prolonged ante-natal life and
 an intimate partnership between the mother and the unborn young.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 4</h3>

 <p>There is another way of looking at the sublime process of evolution. It
 has implied a mastery of all the possible haunts of life; it has been a
 progressive conquest of the environment.</p>

 <p>1. It is highly probable that living organisms found their foothold in the
 stimulating conditions of the shore of the sea&mdash;the shallow water,
 brightly illumined, seaweed-growing shelf fringing the Continents. This
 littoral zone was a propitious environment where sea and fresh water, earth
 and air all meet, where there is stimulating change, abundant oxygenation and
 a copious supply of nutritive material in what the streams bring down and in
 the rich seaweed vegetation.</p>

 <p>It is not an easy haunt of life, but none the worse for that, and it is
 tenanted to-day by representatives of practically every class of animals from
 infusorians to seashore birds and mammals.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Cradle of the Open Sea</h4>

 <p>2. The open-sea or pelagic haunt includes all the brightly illumined
 surface waters beyond the shallow water of the shore area.</p>

 <p>It is perhaps the easiest of all the haunts of life, for there is no
 crowding, there is considerable uniformity, and an abundance of food for
 animals is afforded by the inexhaustible floating &quot;sea-meadows&quot; of
 microscopic Algæ. These are reincarnated in minute animals like the open-sea
 crustaceans, which again are utilised by fishes, these in turn making life
 possible for higher forms like carnivorous turtles and toothed whales. It is
 quite possible that the open sea was the original cradle of life and perhaps
 Professor Church is right in picturing a long period of pelagic life before
 there was any sufficiently shallow water to allow the floating plants to
 anchor. It is rather in favour of this view that many shore animals such as
 crabs and starfishes, spend their youthful stages in the relatively safe
 cradle of the open sea, and only return to the more strenuous conditions of
 their birthplace after they have gained considerable strength of body. It is
 probably safe to say that the honour of being the original cradle of life
 lies between the shore of the sea and the open sea.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Great Deeps</h4>

 <p>3. A third haunt of life is the floor of the Deep Sea, the abyssal area,
 which occupies more than a half of the surface of the globe. It is a region
 of extreme cold&mdash;an eternal winter; of utter darkness&mdash;an eternal
 night&mdash;relieved only by the fitful gleams of &quot;phosphorescent&quot;
 animals; of enormous pressure&mdash;2½ tons on<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> the square inch at a depth of 2,500
 fathoms; of profound calm, unbroken silence, immense monotony. And as there
 are no plants in the great abysses, the animals must live on one another,
 and, in the long run, on the rain of moribund animalcules which sink from the
 surface through the miles of water. It seems a very unpromising haunt of
 life, but it is abundantly tenanted, and it gives us a glimpse of the
 insurgent nature of the living creature that the difficulties of the Deep Sea
 should have been so effectively conquered. It is probable that the colonising
 of the great abysses took place in relatively recent times, for the fauna
 does not include many very antique types. It is practically certain that the
 colonisation was due to littoral animals which followed the food-débris,
 millennium after millennium, further and further down the long slope from the
 shore.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Freshwaters</h4>

 <p>4. A fourth haunt of life is that of the freshwaters, including river and
 lake, pond and pool, swamp and marsh. It may have been colonised by gradual
 migration up estuaries and rivers, or by more direct passage from the
 seashore into the brackish swamp. Or it may have been in some cases that
 partially landlocked corners of ancient seas became gradually turned into
 freshwater basins. The animal population of the freshwaters is very
 representative, and is diversely adapted to meet the characteristic
 contingencies&mdash;the risk of being dried up, the risk of being frozen hard
 in winter, and the risk of being left high and dry after floods or of being
 swept down to the sea.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Conquest of the Dry Land</h4>

 <p>5. The terrestrial haunt has been invaded age after age by contingents
 from the sea or from the freshwaters. We must recognise the worm invasion,
 which led eventually to the making of the fertile soil, the invasion due to
 air-breathing Arthropods,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id=
 "Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> which led eventually to the important linkage
 between flowers and their insect visitors, and the invasion due to
 air-breathing Amphibians, which led eventually to the higher terrestrial
 animals and to the development of intelligence and family affection. Besides
 these three great invasions, there were minor ones such as that leading to
 land-snails, for there has been a widespread and persistent tendency among
 aquatic animals to try to possess the dry land.</p>

 <p>Getting on to dry land had a manifold significance.</p>

 <p>It implied getting into a medium with a much larger supply of oxygen than
 there is dissolved in the water. But the oxygen of the air is more difficult
 to capture, especially when the skin becomes hard or well protected, as it is
 almost bound to become in animals living on dry ground. Thus this leads to
 the development of <i>internal surfaces</i>, such as those of lungs, where
 the oxygen taken into the body may be absorbed by the blood. In most animals
 the blood goes to the surface of oxygen-capture; but in insects and their
 relatives there is a different idea&mdash;of taking the air to the blood or
 in greater part to the area of oxygen-combustion, the living tissues. A
 system of branching air-tubes takes air into every hole and corner of the
 insect&#39;s body, and this thorough aeration is doubtless in part the secret
 of the insect&#39;s intense activity. The blood never becomes impure.</p>

 <p>The conquest of the dry land also implied a predominance of that kind of
 locomotion which may be compared to punting, when the body is pushed along by
 pressing a lever against a hard substratum. And it also followed that with
 few exceptions the body of the terrestrial animal tended to be compact,
 readily lifted off the ground by the limbs or adjusted in some other way so
 that there may not be too large a surface trailing on the ground. An animal
 like a jellyfish, easily supported in the water, would be impossible on land.
 Such apparent exceptions as earthworms, centipedes, and snakes are not
 difficult to explain, for the earthworm<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> is a burrower which eats its way
 through the soil, the centipede&#39;s long body is supported by numerous hard
 legs, and the snake pushes itself along by means of the large ventral scales
 to which the lower ends of very numerous ribs are attached.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Methods of Mastering the Difficulties of Terrestrial
 Life</h4>

 <p>A great restriction attendant on the invasion of the dry land is that
 locomotion becomes limited to one plane, namely, the surface of the earth.
 This is in great contrast to what is true in the water, where the animal can
 move up or down, to right or to left, at any angle and in three dimensions.
 It surely follows from this that the movements of land animals must be rapid
 and precise, unless, indeed, safety is secured in some other way. Hence it is
 easy to understand why most land animals have very finely developed striped
 muscles, and why a beetle running on the ground has far more numerous muscles
 than a lobster swimming in the sea.</p>

 <p>Land animals were also handicapped by the risks of drought and of frost,
 but these were met by defences of the most diverse description, from the
 hairs of woolly caterpillars to the fur of mammals, from the carapace of
 tortoises to the armour of armadillos. In other cases, it is hardly necessary
 to say, the difficulties may be met in other ways, as frogs meet the winter
 by falling into a lethargic state in some secluded retreat.</p>

 <p>Another consequence of getting on to dry land is that the eggs or young
 can no longer be set free anyhow, as is possible when the animal is
 surrounded by water, which is in itself more or less of a cradle. If the eggs
 were laid or the young liberated on dry ground, the chances are many that
 they would be dried up or devoured. So there are numerous ways in which land
 animals secure the safety of their young, e.g. by burying them in the ground,
 or by hiding them in nests, or by carrying them about for a prolonged period
 either before or after birth. This may mean great safety for the young, this
 may make it possible to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id=
 "Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> only a small family, and this may tend to the
 evolution of parental care and the kindly emotions. Thus it may be understood
 that from the conquest of the land many far-reaching consequences have
 followed.</p>

 <p>Finally, it is worth dwelling on the risks of terrestrial life, because
 they enable us better to understand why so many land animals have become
 burrowers and others climbers of trees, why some have returned to the water
 and others have taken to the air. It may be asked, perhaps, why the land
 should have been colonised at all when the risks and difficulties are so
 great. The answer must be that necessity and curiosity are the mother and
 father of invention. Animals left the water because the pools dried up, or
 because they were overcrowded, or because of inveterate enemies, but also
 because of that curiosity and spirit of adventure which, from first to last,
 has been one of the spurs of progress.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Conquering the Air</h4>

 <p>6. The last great haunt of life is the air, a mastery of which must be
 placed to the credit of insects, Pterodactyls, birds, and bats. These have
 been the successes, but it should be noted that there have been many
 brilliant failures, which have not attained to much more than parachuting.
 These include the Flying Fishes, which take leaps from the water and are
 carried for many yards and to considerable heights, holding their enlarged
 pectoral fins taut or with little more than a slight fluttering. There is a
 so-called Flying Frog (<i>Rhacophorus</i>) that skims from branch to branch,
 and the much more effective Flying Dragon (<i>Draco volans</i>) of the Far
 East, which has been mentioned already. Among mammals there are Flying
 Phalangers, Flying Lemurs, and more besides, all attaining to great skill as
 parachutists, and illustrating the endeavour to master the air which man has
 realised in a way of his own.</p>

 <p>The power of flight brings obvious advantages. A bird feeding<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> on the ground is
 able to evade the stalking carnivore by suddenly rising into the air; food
 and water can be followed rapidly and to great distances; the eggs or the
 young can be placed in safe situations; and birds in their migrations have
 made a brilliant conquest both of time and space. Many of them know no winter
 in their year, and the migratory flight of the Pacific Golden Plover from
 Hawaii to Alaska and back again does not stand alone.</p>

 <h3>THE PROCESSION OF LIFE THROUGH THE AGES</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Rock Record</h4>

 <p>How do we know when the various classes of animals and plants were
 established on the earth? How do we know the order of their appearance and
 the succession of their advances? The answer is: by reading the Rock Record.
 In the course of time the crust of the earth has been elevated into
 continents and depressed into ocean-troughs, and the surface of the land has
 been buckled up into mountain ranges and folded in gentler hills and valleys.
 The high places of the land have been weathered by air and water in many
 forms, and the results of the weathering have been borne away by rivers and
 seas, to be laid down again elsewhere as deposits which eventually formed
 sandstones, mudstones, and similar sedimentary rocks. Much of the material of
 the original crust has thus been broken down and worked up again many times
 over, and if the total thickness of the sedimentary rocks is added up it
 amounts, according to some geologists, to a total of 67 miles. In most cases,
 however, only a small part of this thickness is to be seen in one place, for
 the deposits were usually formed in limited areas at any one time.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Use of Fossils</h4>

 <p>When the sediments were accumulating age after age, it naturally came
 about that remains of the plants and animals living<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> at the time were
 buried, and these formed the fossils by the aid of which it is possible to
 read the story of the past. By careful piecing together of evidence the
 geologist is able to determine the order in which the different sedimentary
 rocks were laid down, and thus to say, for instance, that the Devonian period
 was the time of the origin of Amphibians. In other cases the geologist
 utilises the fossils in his attempt to work out the order of the strata when
 these have been much disarranged. For the simpler fossil forms of any type
 must be older than those that are more complex. There is no vicious circle
 here, for the general succession of strata is clear, and it is quite certain
 that there were fishes before there were amphibians, and amphibians before
 there were reptiles, and reptiles before there were birds and mammals. In
 certain cases, e.g. of fossil horses and elephants, the actual historical
 succession has been clearly worked out.</p>

 <p>If the successive strata contained good samples of all the plants and
 animals living at the time when the beds were formed, then it would be easy
 to read the record of the rocks, but many animals were too soft to become
 satisfactory fossils, many were eaten or dissolved away, many were destroyed
 by heat and pressure, so that the rock record is like a library very much
 damaged by fire and looting and decay.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Geological Time-table</h4>

 <p>The long history of the earth and its inhabitants is conveniently divided
 into eras. Thus, just as we speak of the ancient, mediæval, and modern
 history of mankind, so we may speak of Palæozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras
 in the history of the earth as a whole.</p>

 <p>Geologists cannot tell us except in an approximate way how long the
 process of evolution has taken. One of the methods is to estimate how long
 has been required for the accumulation of<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> the salts of the sea, for all these
 have been dissolved out of the rocks since rain began to fall on the earth.
 Dividing the total amount of saline matter by what is contributed every year
 in modern times, we get about a hundred million years as the age of the sea.
 But as the present rate of salt-accumulation is probably much greater than it
 was during many of the geological periods, the prodigious age just mentioned
 is in all likelihood far below the mark. Another method is to calculate how
 long it would take to form the sedimentary rocks, like sandstones and
 mudstones, which have a <i>total</i> thickness of over fifty miles, though
 the <i>local</i> thickness is rarely over a mile. As most of the materials
 have come from the weathering of the earth&#39;s crust, and as the annual
 amount of weathering now going on can be estimated, the time required for the
 formation of the sedimentary rocks of the world can be approximately
 calculated. There are some other ways of trying to tell the earth&#39;s age
 and the length of the successive periods, but no certainty has been
 reached.</p>

 <p>The eras marked on the table (page 92) as <i>before the Cambrian</i>
 correspond to about thirty-two miles of thickness of strata; and all the
 subsequent eras with fossil-bearing rocks to a thickness of about twenty-one
 miles&mdash;in itself an astounding fact. Perhaps thirty million years must
 be allotted to the Pre-Cambrian eras, eighteen to the Palæozoic, nine to the
 Mesozoic, three to the Cenozoic, making a grand total of sixty millions.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Establishment of Invertebrate Stocks</h4>

 <p>It is an astounding fact that at least half of geological time (the
 Archæozoic and Proterozoic eras) passed before there were living creatures
 with parts sufficiently hard to form fossils. In the latter part of the
 Proterozoic era there are traces of one-celled marine animals (Radiolarians)
 with shells of flint, and of worms that wallowed in the primal mud. It is
 plain that as regards the most primitive creatures the rock record tells us
 little.</p>

   getting air through an open pipe to the surface. When water fills the pools
   it can use its gills again. Mud-nests or mud encasements with the lung-fish
   inside have often been brought to Britain and the fish when liberated were
   quite lively.</p>

 <p>The rarity of direct traces of life in the oldest rocks is partly due to
 the fact that the primitive animals would be of delicate build, but it must
 also be remembered that the ancient rocks have been profoundly and repeatedly
 changed by pressure and heat, so that the traces which did exist would be
 very liable to obliteration. And if it be asked what right we have to suppose
 the presence of living creatures in the absence or extreme rarity of fossils,
 we must point to great accumulations of limestone which indicate the
 existence of calcareous algæ, and to deposits of iron which probably indicate
 the activity of iron-forming Bacteria. Ancient beds of graphite similarly
 suggest that green plants flourished in these ancient days.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Era of Ancient Life (Palæozoic)</h4>

 <p>The <i>Cambrian</i> period was the time of the establishment of the chief
 stocks of backboneless animals such as sponges, jellyfishes, worms,
 sea-cucumbers, lamp-shells, trilobites, crustaceans, and molluscs. There is
 something very eloquent in the broad fact that the peopling of the seas had
 definitely begun some thirty million years ago, for Professor H. F. Osborn
 points out that in the Cambrian period there was already a colonisation of
 the shore of the sea, the open sea, and the deep waters.</p>

 <p>The <i>Ordovician</i> period was marked by abundant representation of the
 once very successful class of Trilobites&mdash;jointed-footed,
 antenna-bearing, segmented marine animals, with numerous appendages and a
 covering of chitin. They died away entirely with the end of the Palæozoic
 era. Also very notable was the abundance of predatory cuttlefishes, the
 bullies of the ancient seas. But it was in this period that the first
 backboned animals made their appearance&mdash;an epoch-making step in
 evolution. In other words, true fishes were evolved&mdash;destined in the
 course of ages to replace the cuttlefishes (which are mere molluscs) in
 dominating the seas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg

 <p>In the <i>Silurian</i> period in which the peopling of the seas went on
 apace, there was the first known attempt at colonising the dry land. For in
 Silurian rocks there are fossil scorpions, and that implies ability to
 breathe dry air&mdash;by means of internal surfaces, in this case known as
 lungbooks. It was also towards the end of the Silurian, when a period of
 great aridity set in, that fishes appeared related to our mud-fishes or
 double-breathers (Dipnoi), which have lungs as well as gills. This, again,
 meant utilising dry air, just as the present-day mud-fishes do when the water
 disappears from the pools in hot weather. The lung-fishes or mud-fishes of
 to-day are but three in number, one in Queensland, one in South America, and
 one in Africa, but they are extremely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93"
 id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> interesting &quot;living fossils,&quot;
 binding the class of fishes to that of amphibians. It is highly probable that
 the first invasion of the dry land should be put to the credit of some
 adventurous worms, but the second great invasion was certainly due to
 air-breathing Arthropods, like the pioneer scorpion we mentioned.</p>

 <p>The <i>Devonian</i> period, including that of the Old Red Sandstone, was
 one of the most significant periods in the earth&#39;s history. For it was
 the time of the establishment of flowering plants upon the earth and of
 terrestrial backboned animals. One would like to have been the discoverer of
 the Devonian foot-print of <i>Thinopus</i>, the first known Amphibian
 foot-print&mdash;an eloquent vestige of the third great invasion of the dry
 land. It was probably from a stock of Devonian lung-fishes that the first
 Amphibians sprang, but it was not till the next period that they came to
 their own. While they were still feeling their way, there was a remarkable
 exuberance of shark-like and heavily armoured fishes in the Devonian
 seas.</p>

 <h3>EVOLUTION OF LAND ANIMALS</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Giant Amphibians and Coal-measures</h4>

 <p>The <i>Carboniferous</i> period was marked by a mild moist climate and a
 luxuriant vegetation in the swampy low grounds. It was a much less strenuous
 time than the Devonian period; it was like a very long summer. There were no
 trees of the type we see now, but there were forests of club-mosses and
 horsetails which grew to a gigantic size compared with their pigmy
 representatives of to-day. In these forests the jointed-footed invaders of
 the dry land ran riot in the form of centipedes, spiders, scorpions, and
 insects, and on these the primeval Amphibians fed. The appearance of insects
 made possible a new linkage of far-reaching importance, namely, the
 cross-fertilisation of flowering plants by their insect visitors, and from
 this time onwards it may be said that flowers and their visitors have evolved
 hand in hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg
 94]</a></span> Cross-fertilisation is much surer by insects than by the wind,
 and cross-fertilisation is more advantageous than self-fertilisation because
 it promotes both fertility and plasticity. It was probably in this period
 that <i>coloured</i> flowers&mdash;attractive to insect-visitors&mdash;began
 to justify themselves as beauty became useful, and began to relieve the
 monotonous green of the horsetail and club-moss forests, which covered great
 tracts of the earth for millions of years. In the Carboniferous forests there
 were also land-snails, representing one of the minor invasions of the dry
 land, tending on the whole to check vegetation. They, too, were probably
 preyed upon by the Amphibians, some of which attained a large size. Each age
 has had its giants, and those of the Carboniferous were Amphibians called
 Labyrinthodonts, some of which were almost as big as donkeys. It need hardly
 be said that it was in this period that most of the Coal-measures were laid
 down by the immense accumulation of the spores and debris of the club-moss
 forests. Ages afterwards, it was given to man to tap this great source of
 energy&mdash;traceable back to the sunshine of millions of years ago. Even
 then it was true that no plant or animal lives or dies to itself!</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Acquisitions of Amphibians.</h4>

 <p>As Amphibians had their Golden Age in the Carboniferous period we may
 fitly use this opportunity of indicating the advances in evolution which the
 emergence of Amphibians implied. (1) In the first place the passage from
 water to dry land was the beginning of a higher and more promiseful life,
 taxed no doubt by increased difficulties. The natural question rises why
 animals should have migrated from water to dry land at all when great
 difficulties were involved in the transition. The answers must be: (<i>a</i>)
 that local drying up of water-basins or elevations of the land surface often
 made the old haunts untenable; (<i>b</i>) that there may have been great
 congestion and competition in the old quarters; and (<i>c</i>) that there has
 been an undeniable endeavour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id=
 "Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> after well-being throughout the history of
 animal life. In the same way with mankind, migrations were prompted by the
 setting in of prolonged drought, by over-population, and by the spirit of
 adventure. (2) In Amphibians for the first time the non-digitate paired fins
 of fishes were replaced by limbs with fingers and toes. This implied an
 advantageous power of grasping, of holding firm, of putting food into the
 mouth, of feeling things in three dimensions. (3) We cannot be positive in
 regard to the soft parts of the ancient Amphibians known only as fossils, but
 if they were in a general way like the frogs and toads, newts and salamanders
 of the present day, we may say that they made among other acquisitions the
 following: true ventral lungs, a three-chambered heart, a movable tongue, a
 drum to the ear, and lids to the eyes. It is very interesting to find that
 though the tongue of the tadpole has some muscle-fibres in it, they are not
 strong enough to effect movement, recalling the tongue of fishes, which has
 not any muscles at all. Gradually, as the tadpole becomes a frog, the
 muscle-fibres grow in strength, and make it possible for the full-grown
 creature to shoot out its tongue upon insects. This is probably a
 recapitulation of what was accomplished in the course of millennia in the
 history of the Amphibian race. (4) Another acquisition made by Amphibians was
 a voice, due, as in ourselves, to the rapid passage of air over taut
 membranes (vocal cords) stretched in the larynx. It is an interesting fact
 that for millions of years there was upon the earth no sound of life at all,
 only the noise of wind and wave, thunder and avalanche. Apart from the
 instrumental music of some insects, perhaps beginning in the Carboniferous,
 the first vital sounds were due to Amphibians, and theirs certainly was the
 first voice&mdash;surely one of the great steps in organic evolution.</p>

  </div>
 </div>

 <h4 class="sect">Evolution of the Voice</h4>

 <p>The first use of the voice was probably that indicated by our frogs and
 toads&mdash;it serves as a sex-call. That is the meaning<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> of the trumpeting
 with which frogs herald the spring, and it is often only in the males that
 the voice is well developed. But if we look forward, past Amphibians
 altogether, we find the voice becoming a maternal call helping to secure the
 safety of the young&mdash;a use very obvious when young birds squat
 motionless at the sound of the parent&#39;s danger-note. Later on, probably,
 the voice became an infantile call, as when the unhatched crocodile pipes
 from within the deeply buried egg, signalling to the mother that it is time
 to be unearthed. Higher still the voice expresses emotion, as in the song of
 birds, often outside the limits of the breeding time. Later still, particular
 sounds become words, signifying particular things or feelings, such as
 &quot;food,&quot; &quot;danger,&quot; &quot;home,&quot; &quot;anger,&quot;
 and &quot;joy.&quot; Finally words become a medium of social intercourse and
 as symbols help to make it possible for man to reason.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Early Reptiles</h4>

 <p>In the <i>Permian</i> period reptiles appeared, or perhaps one should say,
 began to assert themselves. That is to say, there was an emergence of
 backboned animals which were free from water and relinquished the method of
 breathing by gills, which Amphibians retained in their young stages at least.
 The unhatched or unborn reptile breathes by means of a vascular hood spread
 underneath the egg-shell and absorbing dry air from without. It is an
 interesting point that this vascular hood, called the allantois, is
 represented in the Amphibians by an unimportant bladder growing out from the
 hind end of the food-canal. A great step in evolution was implied in the
 origin of this ante-natal hood or f&oelig;tal membrane and another
 one&mdash;of protective significance&mdash;called the amnion, which forms a
 water-bag over the delicate embryo. The step meant total emancipation from
 the water and from gill-breathing, and the two f&oelig;tal membranes, the
 amnion and the allantois, persist not only in all reptiles but in birds
 and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
 mammals as well. These higher Vertebrates are therefore called Amniota in
 contrast to the Lower Vertebrates or Anamnia (the Amphibians, Fishes, and
 primitive types).</p>

 <p>It is a suggestive fact that the embryos of all reptiles, birds, and
 mammals show gill-clefts&mdash;<i>a tell-tale evidence of their distant
 aquatic ancestry</i>. But these embryonic gill-clefts are not used for
 respiration and show no trace of gills except in a few embryonic reptiles and
 birds where their dwindled vestiges have been recently discovered. As to the
 gill-clefts, they are of no use in higher Vertebrates except that the first
 becomes the Eustachian tube leading from the ear-passage to the back of the
 mouth. The reason why they persist when only one is of any use, and that in a
 transformed guise, would be difficult to interpret except in terms of the
 Evolution theory. They illustrate the lingering influence of a long pedigree,
 the living hand of the past, the tendency that individual development has to
 recapitulate racial evolution. In a condensed and telescoped manner, of
 course, for what took the race a million years may be recapitulated by the
 individual in a week!</p>

 <p>In the Permian period the warm moist climate of most of the Carboniferous
 period was replaced by severe conditions, culminating in an Ice Age which
 spread from the Southern Hemisphere throughout the world. With this was
 associated a waning of the Carboniferous flora, and the appearance of a new
 one, consisting of ferns, conifers, ginkgos, and cycads, which persisted
 until near the end of the Mesozoic era. The Permian Ice Age lasted for
 millions of years, and was most severe in the Far South. Of course, it was a
 very different world then, for North Europe was joined to North America,
 Africa to South America, and Australia to Asia. It was probably during the
 Permian Ice Age that many of the insects divided their life-history into two
 main chapters&mdash;the feeding, growing, moulting, immature, larval stages,
 e.g. caterpillars, and the more ascetic, non-growing, non-moulting, winged
 phase, adapted for reproduction. Between<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> these there intervened the
 quiescent, well-protected pupa stage or chrysalis, probably adapted to begin
 with as a means of surviving the severe winter. For it is easier for an
 animal to survive when the vital processes are more or less in abeyance.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Disappearance of many Ancient Types</h4>

 <p>We cannot leave the last period of the Palæozoic era and its prolonged ice
 age without noticing that it meant the entire cessation of a large number of
 ancient types, especially among plants and backboneless animals, which now
 disappear for ever. It is necessary to understand that the animals of ancient
 days stand in three different relations to those of to-day. (<i>a</i>) There
 are ancient types that have living representatives, sometimes few and
 sometimes many, sometimes much changed and sometimes but slightly changed.
 The lamp-shell, <i>Lingulella</i>, of the Cambrian and Ordovician period has
 a very near relative in the <i>Lingula</i> of to-day. There are a few
 extremely conservative animals. (<i>b</i>) There are ancient types which have
 no living representatives, except in the guise of transformed descendants, as
 the King-crab (<i>Limulus</i>) may be said to be a transformed descendant of
 the otherwise quite extinct race to which Eurypterids or Sea-scorpions
 belonged. (<i>c</i>) There are altogether extinct types&mdash;<i>lost
 races</i>&mdash;which have left not a wrack behind. For there is not any
 representation to-day of such races as Graptolites and Trilobites.</p>

 <p>Looking backwards over the many millions of years comprised in the
 Palæozoic era, what may we emphasise as the most salient features? There was
 in the <i>Cambrian</i> the establishment of the chief classes of backboneless
 animals; in the <i>Ordovician</i> the first fishes and perhaps the first
 terrestrial plants; in the <i>Silurian</i> the emergence of air-breathing
 Invertebrates and mud-fishes; in the <i>Devonian</i> the appearance of the
 first Amphibians, from which all higher land animals are descended, and the
 establishment of a land flora; in the <i>Carboniferous</i> the great
 Club-moss forests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg
 99]</a></span> and an exuberance of air-breathing insects and their allies;
 in the <i>Permian</i> the first reptiles and a new flora.</p>

 <h3>THE GEOLOGICAL MIDDLE AGES</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Mesozoic Era</h4>

 <p>In a broad way the Mesozoic era corresponds with the Golden Age of
 reptiles, and with the climax of the Conifer and Cycad flora, which was
 established in the Permian. But among the Conifers and Cycads our modern
 flowering plants were beginning to show face tentatively, just like birds and
 mammals among the great reptiles.</p>

 <p>In the <i>Triassic</i> period the exuberance of reptilian life which
 marked the Permian was continued. Besides Turtles which still persist, there
 were Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Dinosaurs, and Pterosaurs, none of which
 lasted beyond the Mesozoic era. Of great importance was the rise of the
 Dinosaurs in the Triassic, for it is highly probable that within the limits
 of this vigorous and plastic stock&mdash;some of them bipeds&mdash;we must
 look for the ancestors of both birds and mammals. Both land and water were
 dominated by reptiles, some of which attained to gigantic size. Had there
 been any zoologist in those days, he would have been very sagacious indeed if
 he had suspected that reptiles did not represent the climax of creation.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Flying Dragons</h4>

 <p>The <i>Jurassic</i> period showed a continuance of the reptilian
 splendour. They radiated in many directions, becoming adapted to many haunts.
 Thus there were many Fish Lizards paddling in the seas, many types of
 terrestrial dragons stalking about on land, many swiftly gliding
 alligator-like forms, and the Flying Dragons which began in the Triassic
 attained to remarkable success and variety. Their wing was formed by the
 extension of a great fold of skin on the enormously elongated
 outermost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg
 100]</a></span> finger, and they varied from the size of a sparrow to a
 spread of over five feet. A soldering of the dorsal vertebræ as in our Flying
 Birds was an adaptation to striking the air with some force, but as there is
 not more than a slight keel, if any, on the breast-bone, it is unlikely that
 they could fly far. For we know from our modern birds that the power of
 flight may be to some extent gauged from the degree of development of the
 keel, which is simply a great ridge for the better insertion of the muscles
 of flight. It is absent, of course, in the Running Birds, like the ostrich,
 and it has degenerated in an interesting way in the burrowing parrot
 (<i>Stringops</i>) and a few other birds that have &quot;gone back.&quot;</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The First Known Bird</h4>

 <p>But the Jurassic is particularly memorable because its strata have yielded
 two fine specimens of the first known bird, <i>Archæopteryx</i>. These were
 entombed in the deposits which formed the fine-grained lithographic stones of
 Bavaria, and practically every bone in the body is preserved except the
 breast-bone. Even the feathers have left their marks with distinctness. This
 oldest known bird&mdash;too far advanced to be the first bird&mdash;was about
 the size of a crow and was probably of arboreal habits. Of great interest are
 its reptilian features, so pronounced that one cannot evade the evolutionist
 suggestion. It had teeth in both jaws, which no modern bird has; it had a
 long lizard-like tail, which no modern bird has; it had claws on three
 fingers, and a sort of half-made wing. That is to say, it does not show, what
 all modern birds show, a fusion of half the wrist-bones with the whole of the
 palm-bones, the well-known carpo-metacarpus bone which forms a basis for the
 longest pinions. In many reptiles, such as Crocodiles, there are peculiar
 bones running across the abdomen beneath the skin, the so-called
 &quot;abdominal ribs,&quot; and it seems an eloquent detail to find these
 represented in <i>Archæopteryx</i>, the earliest known bird. No modern bird
 shows any trace of them.</p>

 <p>There is no warrant for supposing that the flying reptiles or Pterodactyls
 gave rise to birds, for the two groups are on different lines, and the
 structure of the wings is entirely different. Thus the long-fingered
 Pterodactyl wing was a parachute wing, while the secret of the bird&#39;s
 wing has its centre in the feathers. It is highly probable that birds evolved
 from certain Dinosaurs which had become bipeds, and it is possible that they
 were for a time swift runners that took &quot;flying jumps&quot; along the
 ground. Thereafter, perhaps, came a period of arboreal apprenticeship during
 which there was much gliding from tree to tree before true flight was
 achieved. It is an interesting fact that the problem of flight has been
 solved four times among animals&mdash;by insects, by Pterodactyls, by birds,
 and by bats; and that the four solutions are on entirely different lines.</p>

 <p>In the <i>Cretaceous</i> period the outstanding events included the waning
 of giant reptiles, the modernising of the flowering plants, and the
 multiplication of small mammals. Some of the Permian reptiles, such as the
 dog-toothed Cynodonts, were extraordinarily mammal-like, and it was probably
 from among them that definite mammals emerged in the Triassic. Comparatively
 little is known of the early Triassic mammals save that their back-teeth were
 marked by numerous tubercles on the crown, but they were gaining strength in
 the late Triassic when small arboreal insectivores, not very distant from the
 modern tree-shrews (<i>Tupaia</i>), began to branch out in many directions
 indicative of the great divisions of modern mammals, such as the clawed
 mammals, hoofed mammals, and the race of monkeys or Primates. In the Upper
 Cretaceous there was an exuberant &quot;radiation&quot; of mammals, adaptive
 to the conquest of all sorts of haunts, and this was vigorously continued in
 Tertiary times.</p>

 <p>There is no difficulty in the fact that the earliest remains of definite
 mammals in the Triassic precede the first-known bird in the Jurassic. For
 although we usually rank mammals as higher than birds (being mammals
 ourselves, how could we do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id=
 "Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> otherwise?), there are many ways in which
 birds are pre-eminent, e.g. in skeleton, musculature, integumentary
 structures, and respiratory system. The fact is that birds and mammals are on
 two quite different tacks of evolution, not related to one another, save in
 having a common ancestry in extinct reptiles. Moreover, there is no reason to
 believe that the Jurassic <i>Archæopteryx</i> was the first bird in any sense
 except that it is the first of which we have any record. In any case it is
 safe to say that birds came to their own before mammals did.</p>

 <p>Looking backwards, we may perhaps sum up what is most essential in the
 Mesozoic era in Professor Schuchert&#39;s sentence: &quot;The Mesozoic is the
 Age of Reptiles, and yet the little mammals and the toothed birds are storing
 up intelligence and strength to replace the reptiles when the cycads and
 conifers shall give way to the higher flowering plants.&quot;</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Cenozoic or Tertiary Era</h4>

 <p>In the <i>Eocene</i> period there was a replacement of the small-brained
 archaic mammals by big-brained modernised types, and with this must be
 associated the covering of the earth with a garment of grass and dry pasture.
 Marshes were replaced by meadows and browsing by grazing mammals. In the
 spreading meadows an opportunity was also offered for a richer evolution of
 insects and birds.</p>

 <p>During the <i>Oligocene</i> the elevation of the land continued, the
 climate became much less moist, and the grazing herds extended their
 range.</p>

 <p>The <i>Miocene</i> was the mammalian Golden Age and there were crowning
 examples of what Osborn calls &quot;adaptive radiation.&quot; That is to say,
 mammals, like the reptiles before them, conquer every haunt of life. There
 are flying bats, volplaning parachutists, climbers in trees like sloths and
 squirrels, quickly moving hoofed mammals, burrowers like the moles,
 freshwater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg
 103]</a></span> mammals, like duckmole and beaver, shore-frequenting seals
 and manatees, and open-sea cetaceans, some of which dive far more than full
 fathoms five. It is important to realise the perennial tendency of animals to
 conquer every corner and to fill every niche of opportunity, and to notice
 that this has been done by successive sets of animals in succeeding ages.
 <i>Most notably the mammals repeat all the experiments of reptiles on a
 higher turn of the spiral.</i> Thus arises what is called convergence, the
 superficial resemblance of unrelated types, like whales and fishes, the
 resemblance being due to the fact that the different types are similarly
 adapted to similar conditions of life. Professor H. F. Osborn points out that
 mammals may seek any one of the twelve different habitat-zones, and that in
 each of these there may be six quite different kinds of food. Living
 creatures penetrate everywhere like the overflowing waters of a great river
 in flood.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 3</h3>

 <p>The <i>Pliocene</i> period was a more strenuous time, with less genial
 climatic conditions, and with more intense competition. Old land bridges were
 broken and new ones made, and the geographical distribution underwent great
 changes. Professor R. S. Lull describes the <i>Pliocene</i> as &quot;a period
 of great unrest.&quot; &quot;Many migrations occurred the world over, new
 competitions arose, and the weaker stocks began to show the effects of the
 strenuous life. One momentous event seems to have occurred in the Pliocene,
 and that was the transformation of the precursor of humanity into
 man&mdash;the culmination of the highest line of evolution.&quot;</p>

 <p>The <i>Pleistocene</i> period was a time of sifting. There was a continued
 elevation of the continental masses, and Ice Ages set in, relieved by less
 severe interglacial times when the ice-sheets retreated northwards for a
 time. Many types, like the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the sabre-toothed
 tiger, the cave-lion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id=
 "Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> and the cave-bear, became extinct. Others
 which formerly had a wide range became restricted to the Far North or were
 left isolated here and there on the high mountains, like the Snow Mouse,
 which now occurs on isolated Alpine heights above the snow-line. Perhaps it
 was during this period that many birds of the Northern Hemisphere learned to
 evade the winter by the sublime device of migration.</p>

 <p>Looking backwards we may quote Professor Schuchert again:</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>&quot;The lands in the Cenozoic began to bloom with more and more
  flowering plants and grand hardwood forests, the atmosphere is scented with
  sweet odours, a vast crowd of new kinds of insects appear, and the places of
  the once dominant reptiles of the lands and seas are taken by the mammals.
  Out of these struggles there rises a greater intelligence, seen in nearly
  all of the mammal stocks, but particularly in one, the monkey-ape-man. Brute
  man appears on the scene with the introduction of the last glacial climate,
  a most trying time for all things endowed with life, and finally there
  results the dominance of reasoning man over all his brute
  associates.&quot;</p>
 </div>

 <p>In man and human society the story of evolution has its climax.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Ascent of Man</h4>

 <p>Man stands apart from animals in his power of building up general ideas
 and of using these in the guidance of his behaviour and the control of his
 conduct. This is essentially wrapped up with his development of language as
 an instrument of thought. Some animals have words, but man has language
 (Logos). Some animals show evidence of <i>perceptual</i> inference, but man
 often gets beyond this to <i>conceptual</i> inference (Reason). Many animals
 are affectionate and brave, self-forgetful and industrious, but man
 &quot;thinks the ought,&quot; definitely guiding his conduct in the light of
 ideals, which in turn are wrapped up with the fact that he is &quot;a social
 person.&quot;</p>

 <p>Besides his big brain, which may be three times as heavy as<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> that of a
 gorilla, man has various physical peculiarities. He walks erect, he plants
 the sole of his foot flat on the ground, he has a chin and a good heel, a big
 forehead and a non-protrusive face, a relatively uniform set of teeth without
 conspicuous canines, and a relatively naked body.</p>

   palm; and then the fingers.</p>

 </div>

 <p>But in spite of man&#39;s undeniable apartness, there is no doubt as to
 his solidarity with the rest of creation. There is an &quot;all-pervading
 similitude of structure,&quot; between man and the Anthropoid Apes, though it
 is certain that it is not from any living form that he took his origin. None
 of the anatomical distinctions, except the heavy brain, could be called
 momentous. Man&#39;s body is a veritable museum of relics (vestigial
 structures) inherited from pre-human ancestors. In his everyday bodily life
 and in some of its disturbances, man&#39;s pedigree is often revealed. Even
 his facial expression, as Darwin showed, is not always human. Some fossil
 remains bring modern man nearer the anthropoid type.</p>

 <p>It is difficult not to admit the ring of truth in the closing words of
 Darwin&#39;s <i>Descent of Man</i>:</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>&quot;We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man, with
  all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased,
  with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest
  living creature, with his God-like intellect which has penetrated into the
  movements and constitution of the solar system&mdash;with all these exalted
  powers&mdash;man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his
  lowly origin.&quot;</p>
 </div>

 <h3><span class="smcap">The Evolving System of Nature</span></h3>

 <p>There is another side of evolution so obvious that it is often overlooked,
 the tendency to link lives together in vital inter-relations. Thus flowers
 and their insect visitors are often vitally interlinked in mutual dependence.
 Many birds feed on berries and distribute the seeds. The tiny freshwater
 snail is the host of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id=
 "Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> the juvenile stages of the liver-fluke of the
 sheep. The mosquito is the vehicle of malaria from man to man, and the
 tse-tse fly spreads sleeping sickness. The freshwater mussel cannot continue
 its race without the unconscious co-operation of the minnow, and the
 freshwater fish called the bitterling cannot continue its race without the
 unconscious co-operation of the mussel. There are numerous mutually
 beneficial partnerships between different kinds of creatures, and other
 inter-relations where the benefit is one-sided, as in the case of insects
 that make galls on plants. There are also among kindred animals many forms of
 colonies, communities, and societies. Nutritive chains bind long series of
 animals together, the cod feeding on the whelk, the whelk on the worm, the
 worm on the organic dust of the sea. There is a system of successive
 incarnations and matter is continually passing from one embodiment to
 another. These instances must suffice to illustrate the central biological
 idea of the web of life, the interlinked System of Animate Nature. Linnæus
 spoke of the Systema Naturæ, meaning the orderly hierarchy of classes,
 orders, families, genera, and species; but we owe to Darwin in particular
 some knowledge of a more dynamic Systema Naturæ, the network of vital
 inter-relations. This has become more and more complex as evolution has
 continued, and man&#39;s web is most complex of all. It means making Animate
 Nature more of a unity; it means an external method of registering steps of
 progress; it means an evolving set of sieves by which new variations are
 sifted, and living creatures are kept from slipping down the steep ladder of
 evolution.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Parasitism</h4>

 <p>It sometimes happens that the inter-relation established between one
 living creature and another works in a retrograde direction. This is the case
 with many thoroughgoing internal parasites which have sunk into an easygoing
 kind of life, utterly dependent on their host for food, requiring no
 exertions, running<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg
 107]</a></span> no risks, and receiving no spur to effort. Thus we see that
 evolution is not necessarily progressive; everything depends on the
 conditions in reference to which the living creatures have been evolved. When
 the conditions are too easygoing, the animal may be thoroughly well adapted
 to them&mdash;as a tapeworm certainly is&mdash;but it slips down the rungs of
 the ladder of evolution.</p>

 <p>This is an interesting minor chapter in the story of evolution&mdash;the
 establishment of different kinds of parasites, casual and constant, temporary
 and lifelong, external hangers-on and internal unpaying boarders, those that
 live in the food-canal and depend on the host&#39;s food and those that
 inhabit the blood or the tissues and find their food there. It seems clear
 that ichneumon grubs and the like which hatch inside a caterpillar and eat it
 alive are not so much parasites as &quot;beasts of prey&quot; working from
 within.</p>

 <p>But there are two sides to this minor chapter: there is the evolution of
 the parasite, and there is also the evolution of counteractive measures on
 the part of the host. Thus there is the maintenance of a bodyguard of
 wandering am&oelig;boid cells, which tackle the microbes invading the body
 and often succeed in overpowering and digesting them. Thus, again, there is
 the protective capacity the blood has of making antagonistic substances or
 &quot;anti-bodies&quot; which counteract poisons, including the poisons which
 the intruding parasites often make.</p>

 <h3>THE EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION&mdash;HOW IT CAME ABOUT</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Progress in Evolution</h4>

 <p>There has often been slipping back and degeneracy in the course of
 evolution, but the big fact is that there has been progress. For millions of
 years Life has been slowly creeping upwards, and if we compare the highest
 animals&mdash;Birds and Mammals&mdash;with their predecessors, we must admit
 that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg
 108]</a></span> are more controlled, more masters of their fate, with more
 mentality. Evolution is on the whole <i>integrative</i>; that is to say, it
 makes against instability and disorder, and towards harmony and progress.
 Even in the rise of Birds and Mammals we can discern that the evolutionary
 process was making towards a fuller embodiment or expression of what Man
 values most&mdash;control, freedom, understanding, and love. The advance of
 animal life through the ages has been chequered, but on the whole it has been
 an advance towards increasing fullness, freedom, and fitness of life. In the
 study of this advance&mdash;the central fact of Organic Evolution&mdash;there
 is assuredly much for Man&#39;s instruction and much for his
 encouragement.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Evidences of Evolution</h4>

 <p>In all this, it may be said, the fact of evolution has been taken for
 granted, but what are the evidences? Perhaps it should be frankly answered
 that the idea of evolution, that the present is the child of the past and the
 parent of the future, cannot be <i>proved</i> as one may prove the Law of
 Gravitation. All that can be done is to show that it is a key&mdash;a way of
 looking at things&mdash;that fits the facts. There is no lock that it does
 not open.</p>

 <p>But if the facts that the evolution theory vividly interprets be called
 the evidences of its validity, there is no lack of them. There is
 <i>historical</i> evidence; and what is more eloquent than the general fact
 that fishes emerge before amphibians, and these before reptiles, and these
 before birds, and so on? There are wonderfully complete fossil series, e.g.
 among cuttlefishes, in which we can almost see evolution in process. The
 pedigree of horse and elephant and crocodile is in general very convincing,
 though it is to be confessed that there are other cases in regard to which we
 have no light. Who can tell, for instance, how Vertebrates arose or from what
 origin?</p>

 <p>There is <i>embryological</i> evidence, for the individual
 development<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg
 109]</a></span> often reads like an abbreviated recapitulation of the
 presumed evolution of the race. The mammal&#39;s visceral clefts are
 tell-tale evidence of remote aquatic ancestors, breathing by gills. Something
 is known in regard to the historical evolution of antlers in bygone ages; the
 Red Deer of to-day recapitulates at least the general outlines of the
 history. The individual development of an asymmetrical flat-fish, like a
 plaice or sole, which rests and swims on one side, tells us plainly that its
 ancestors were symmetrical fishes.</p>

 <p>There is what might be called <i>physiological</i> evidence, for many
 plants and animals are variable before our eyes, and evolution is going on
 around us to-day. This is familiarly seen among domesticated animals and
 cultivated plants, but there is abundant flux in Wild Nature. It need hardly
 be said that some organisms are very conservative, and that change need not
 be expected when a position of stable equilibrium has been secured.</p>

 <p>There is also <i>anatomical</i> evidence of a most convincing quality. In
 the fore-limbs of backboned animals, say, the paddle of a turtle, the wing of
 a bird, the flipper of a whale, the fore-leg of a horse, and the arm of a
 man; the same essential bones and muscles are used to such diverse results!
 What could it mean save blood relationship? And as to the two sets of teeth
 in whalebone whales, which never even cut the gum, is there any alternative
 but to regard them as relics of useful teeth which ancestral forms possessed?
 In short, the evolution theory is justified by the way in which it works.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Factors in Evolution</h4>

 <p>If it be said &quot;So much for the <i>fact</i> of evolution, but what of
 the <i>factors</i>?&quot; the answer is not easy. For not only is the problem
 the greatest of all scientific problems, but the inquiry is still very young.
 The scientific study of evolution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id=
 "Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> practically dates from the publication of
 <i>The Origin of Species</i> in 1859.</p>

 <p>Heritable novelties or variations often crop up in living creatures, and
 these form the raw material of evolution. These variations are the outcome of
 expression of changes in the germ-cells that develop into organisms. But why
 should there be changes in the constitution of the germ-cells? Perhaps
 because the living material is very complex and inherently liable to change;
 perhaps because it is the vehicle of a multitude of hereditary items among
 which there are very likely to be reshufflings or rearrangements; perhaps
 because the germ-cells have very changeful surroundings (the blood, the
 body-cavity fluid, the sea-water); perhaps because deeply saturating outside
 influences, such as change of climate and habitat, penetrate through the body
 to its germ-cells and provoke them to vary. But we must be patient with the
 wearisome reiteration of &quot;perhaps.&quot; Moreover, every many-celled
 organism reproduced in the usual way, arises from an egg-cell fertilised by a
 sperm-cell, and the changes involved in and preparatory to this fertilisation
 may make new permutations and combinations of the living items and hereditary
 qualities not only possible but necessary. It is something like shuffling a
 pack of cards, but the cards are living. As to the changes wrought on the
 body during its lifetime by peculiarities in nurture, habits, and
 surroundings, these dents or modifications are often very important for the
 individual, but it does not follow that they are directly important for the
 race, since it is not certain that they are transmissible.</p>

 <p>Given a crop of variations or new departures or mutations, whatever the
 inborn novelties may be called, we have then to inquire how these are sifted.
 The sifting, which means the elimination of the relatively less fit
 variations and the selection of the relatively more fit, effected in many
 different ways in the course of the struggle for existence. The organism
 plays its new card in the game of life, and the consequences may
 determine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg
 111]</a></span> survival. The relatively less fit to given conditions will
 tend to be eliminated, while the relatively more fit will tend to survive. If
 the variations are hereditary and reappear, perhaps increased in amount,
 generation after generation, and if the process of sifting continue
 consistently, the result will be the evolution of the species. The sifting
 process may be helped by various forms of &quot;isolation&quot; which lessen
 the range of free intercrossing between members of a species, e.g. by
 geographical barriers. Interbreeding of similar forms tends to make a stable
 stock; out-breeding among dissimilars tends to promote variability. But for
 an outline like this it is enough to suggest the general method of organic
 evolution: Throughout the ages organisms have been making
 tentatives&mdash;new departures of varying magnitude&mdash;and these
 tentatives have been tested. The method is that of testing all things and
 holding fast that which is good.</p>

 <h3>ADAPTATIONS TO ENVIRONMENT</h3>

 <p>We saw in a previous chapter how the process of evolution led to a mastery
 of all the haunts of life. But it is necessary to return to these haunts or
 homes of animals in some detail, so as to understand the peculiar
 circumstances of each, and to see how in the course of ages of struggle all
 sorts of self-preserving and race-continuing adaptations or fitnesses have
 been wrought out and firmly established. Living creatures have spread over
 all the earth and in the waters under the earth; some of them have conquered
 the underground world and others the air. It is possible, however, as has
 been indicated, to distinguish six great haunts of life, each tenanted by a
 distinctive fauna, namely, the shore of the sea, the open sea, the depths of
 the sea, the freshwaters, the dry land, and the air. In the deep sea there
 are no plants at all; in the air the only plants are floating bacteria,
 though there is a sense in which a tree is very aerial, and the orchid
 perched on its branches still more so; in the other four haunts there is a
 flora as well as a fauna&mdash;the two working into one another&#39;s hands
 in interesting and often subtle inter-relations&mdash;the subject of a
 separate study.</p>

 <h3>I. THE SHORE OF THE SEA</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Seaweed Area</h4>

 <p>By the shore of the sea the zoologist means much more than the narrow zone
 between tide-marks; he means the whole of the relatively shallow,
 well-illumined, seaweed-growing shelf around the continents and continental
 islands. Technically, this is called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116"
 id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> the littoral area, and it is divisible into
 zones, each with its characteristic population. It may be noted that the
 green seaweeds are highest up on the shore; the brown ones come next; the
 beautiful red ones are lowest. All of them have got green chlorophyll, which
 enables them to utilise the sun&#39;s rays in photosynthesis (i.e. building
 up carbon compounds from air, water, and salts), but in the brown and red
 seaweeds the green pigment is masked by others. It is maintained by some
 botanists that these other pigments enable their possessors to make more of
 the scantier light in the deeper waters. However this may be, we must always
 think of the shore-haunt as the seaweed-growing area. Directly and indirectly
 the life of the shore animals is closely wrapped up with the seaweeds, which
 afford food and foothold, and temper the force of the waves. The minute
 fragments broken off from seaweeds and from the sea-grass (a flowering plant
 called Zostera) form a sort of nutritive sea-dust which is swept slowly down
 the slope from the shore, to form a very useful deposit in the quietness of
 deepish water. It is often found in the stomachs of marine animals living a
 long way offshore.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Conditions of Shore Life</h4>

 <p>The littoral area as defined is not a large haunt of life; it occupies
 only about 9 million square miles, a small fraction of the 197,000,000 of the
 whole earth&#39;s surface. But it is a very long haunt, some 150,000 miles,
 winding in and out by bay and fiord, estuary and creek. Where deep water
 comes close to cliffs there may be no shore at all; in other places the
 relatively shallow water, with seaweeds growing over the bottom, may extend
 outwards for miles. The nature of the shore varies greatly according to the
 nature of the rocks, according to what the streams bring down from inland,
 and according to the jetsam that is brought in by the tides. The shore is a
 changeful place; there is, in the upper reaches, a striking difference
 between &quot;tide in&quot; and &quot;tide out&quot;; there are vicissitudes
 due to storms, to freshwater floods, to<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> wind-blown sand, and to slow
 changes of level, up and down. The shore is a very crowded haunt, for it is
 comparatively narrow, and every niche among the rocks may be precious.</p>

  </div>
 </div>

 <h4 class="sect">Keen Struggle for Existence</h4>

 <p>It follows that the shore must be the scene of a keen struggle for
 existence&mdash;which includes all the answers-back that living creatures
 make to environing difficulties and limitations. There is struggle for food,
 accentuated by the fact that small items tend to be swept away by the
 outgoing tide or to sink down the slope to deep water. Apart from direct
 competition, e.g. between hungry hermit-crabs, it often involves hard work to
 get a meal. This is true even of apparently sluggish creatures. Thus the
 Crumb-of-Bread Sponge, or any other seashore sponge, has to lash large
 quantities of water through the intricate canal system of its body before it
 can get a sufficient supply of the microscopic organisms and organic
 particles on which it feeds. An index of the intensity of the struggle for
 food is afforded by the nutritive chains which bind animals together. The
 shore is almost noisy with the conjugation of the verb to eat in its many
 tenses. One pound of rock-cod requires for its formation ten pounds of whelk;
 one pound of whelk requires ten pounds of sea-worms; and one pound of worms
 requires ten pounds of sea-dust. Such is the circulation of matter, ever
 passing from one embodiment or incarnation to another.</p>

 <p>Besides struggle for food there is struggle for foothold and for fresh
 air, struggle against the scouring tide and against the pounding breakers.
 The risk of dislodgment is often great and the fracture of limbs is a common
 accident. Of kinds of armour&mdash;the sea-urchin&#39;s hedgehog-like test,
 the crab&#39;s shard, the limpet&#39;s shell&mdash;there is great variety,
 surpassed only by that of weapons&mdash;the sea-anemone&#39;s stinging-cells,
 the sea-urchin&#39;s snapping-blades, the hermit-crab&#39;s forceps, the
 grappling tentacles and parrot&#39;s-beak jaws of the octopus.<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

 <h4 class="sect">Shifts for a Living</h4>

 <p>We get another glimpse of the intensity of the seashore struggle for
 existence in the frequency of &quot;shifts for a living,&quot; adaptations of
 structure or of behaviour which meet frequently recurrent vicissitudes. The
 starfish is often in the dilemma of losing a limb or its life; by a reflex
 action it jettisons the captured arm and escapes. And what is lost is
 gradually regrown. The crab gets its leg broken past all mending; it casts
 off the leg across a weak breakage plane near the base, and within a
 preformed bandage which prevents bleeding a new leg is formed in miniature.
 Such is the adaptive device&mdash;more reflex than reflective&mdash;which is
 called self-mutilation or autotomy.</p>

 <p>In another part of this book there is a discussion of camouflaging and
 protective resemblance; how abundantly these are illustrated on the shore!
 But there are other &quot;shifts for a living.&quot; Some of the sand-hoppers
 and their relatives illustrate the puzzling phenomenon of &quot;feigning
 death,&quot; becoming suddenly so motionless that they escape the eyes of
 their enemies. Cuttlefishes, by discharging sepia from their ink-bags, are
 able to throw dust in the eyes of their enemies. Some undisguised
 shore-animals, e.g. crabs, are adepts in a hide-and-seek game; some fishes,
 like the butterfish or gunnel, escape between stones where there seemed no
 opening and are almost uncatchable in their slipperiness. Subtlest of all,
 perhaps, is the habit some hermit-crabs have of entering into mutually
 beneficial partnership (commensalism) with sea-anemones, which mask their
 bearers and also serve as mounted batteries, getting transport as their
 reward and likewise crumbs from the frequently spread table. But enough has
 been said to show that the shore-haunt exhibits an extraordinary variety of
 shifts for a living.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Parental Care on the Shore</h4>

 <p>According to Darwin, the struggle for existence, as a big fact in the
 economy of Animate Nature, includes not only competition<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> but all the
 endeavours which secure the welfare of the offspring, and give them a good
 send-off in life. So it is without a jolt that we pass from struggle for food
 and foothold to parental care. The marine leech called Pontobdella, an
 interesting greenish warty creature fond of fixing itself to skate, places
 its egg-cocoons in the empty shell of a bivalve mollusc, and guards them for
 weeks, removing any mud that might injure their development. We have seen a
 British starfish with its fully-formed young ones creeping about on its body,
 though the usual mode of development for shore starfishes is that the young
 ones pass through a free-swimming larval period in the open water. The father
 sea-spider carries about the eggs attached to two of his limbs; the father
 sea-horse puts his mate&#39;s eggs into his breast pocket and carries them
 there in safety until they are hatched; the father stickleback of the
 shore-pools makes a seaweed nest and guards the eggs which his wives are
 induced to lay there; the father lumpsucker mounts guard over the bunch of
 pinkish eggs which his mate has laid in a nook of a rocky shore-pool, and
 drives off intruders with zest. He also aerates the developing eggs by
 frequent paddling with his pectoral fins and tail, as the Scots name
 Cock-paidle probably suggests. It is interesting that the salient examples of
 parental care in the shore-haunt are mostly on the male parent&#39;s side.
 But there is maternal virtue as well.</p>

 <p>The fauna of the shore is remarkably <i>representative</i>&mdash;from
 unicellular Protozoa to birds like the oyster-catcher and mammals like the
 seals. Almost all the great groups of animals have apparently served an
 apprenticeship in the shore-haunt, and since lessons learned for millions of
 years sink in and become organically enregistered, it is justifiable to look
 to the shore as a great school in which were gained racial qualities of
 endurance, patience, and alertness.</p>

 <h3>II. THE OPEN SEA</h3>

 <p>In great contrast to the narrow, crowded, difficult conditions of the
 shore-haunt (littoral area) are the spacious, bountiful, and<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> relatively
 easygoing conditions of the open sea (pelagic area), which means the
 well-lighted surface waters quite away from land. Many small organisms have
 their maximum abundance at about fifty fathoms, so that the word
 &quot;surface&quot; is to be taken generously. The light becomes very dim at
 250 fathoms, and the open sea, as a zoological haunt, stops with the light.
 It is hardly necessary to say that the pelagic plants are more abundant near
 the surface, and that below a certain depth the population consists almost
 exclusively of animals. Not a few of the animals sink and rise in the water
 periodically; there are some that come near the surface by day, and others
 that come near the surface by night. Of great interest is the habit of the
 extremely delicate Ctenophores or &quot;sea-gooseberries,&quot; which the
 splash of a wave would tear into shreds. Whenever there is any hint of a
 storm they sink beyond its reach, and the ocean&#39;s surface must have
 remained flat as a mirror for many hours before they can be lured upwards
 from the calm of their deep retreat.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Floating Sea-meadows</h4>

 <p>To understand the vital economy of the open sea, we must recognise the
 incalculable abundance of minute unicellular plants, for they form the
 fundamental food-supply. Along with these must also be included numerous
 microscopic animals which have got possession of chlorophyll, or have entered
 into internal partnership with unicellular Algæ (symbiosis). These green or
 greenish plants and animals are the <i>producers</i>, using the energy of the
 sunlight to help them in building up carbon compounds out of air, water, and
 salts. The animals which feed on the producers, or on other animals, are the
 <i>consumers</i>. Between the two come those open-sea bacteria that convert
 nitrogenous material, e.g. from dead plants or animals that other bacteria
 have rotted, into forms, e.g. nitrates, which plants can re-utilise. The
 importance of these <i>middlemen</i> is great in keeping &quot;the
 circulation of matter&quot; agoing.</p>

 <p>The &quot;floating sea-meadows,&quot; as Sir John Murray called them, are
 always receiving contributions from inshore waters, where the conditions are
 favourable for the prolific multiplication of unicellular Algæ, and there is
 also a certain amount of non-living sea-dust always being swept out from the
 seaweed and sea-grass area.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Swimmers and Drifters</h4>

 <p>The animals of the open sea are conveniently divided into the active
 swimmers (Nekton) and the more passive drifters (Plankton). The swimmers
 include whales great and small, such birds as the storm petrel, the
 fish-eating turtles and sea-snakes, such fishes as mackerel and herring, the
 winged snails or sea-butterflies on which whalebone whales largely feed, some
 of the active cuttles or squids, various open-sea prawns and their relatives,
 some worms like the transparent arrow-worm, and such active Protozoa as
 Noctiluca, whose luminescence makes the waves sparkle in the short summer
 darkness. Very striking as an instance of the insurgence of life are the
 sea-skimmers (Halobatidæ), wingless insects related to the water-measurers in
 the ditch. They are found hundreds of miles from land, skimming on the
 surface of the open sea, and diving in stormy weather. They feed on floating
 dead animals.</p>

 <p>The drifters or easygoing swimmers&mdash;for there is no hard and fast
 line&mdash;are represented, for instance, by the flinty-shelled Radiolarians
 and certain of the chalk-forming animals (Globigerinid Foraminifera); by
 jellyfishes, swimming-bells, and Portuguese men-of-war; by the comb-bearers
 or Ctenophores; by legions of minute Crustaceans; by strange animals called
 Salps, related to the sedentary sea-squirts; and by some sluggish fishes like
 globe-fishes, which often float idly on the surface.</p>

 <p>Open-sea animals tend to be delicately built, with a specific gravity near
 that of the sea-water, with adaptations, such as projecting filaments, which
 help flotation, and with capacities of<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> rising and sinking according to
 the surrounding conditions. Many of them are luminescent, and many of them
 are very inconspicuous in the water owing to their transparency or their
 bluish colour. In both cases the significance is obscure.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Hunger and Love</h4>

 <p>Hunger is often very much in evidence in the open sea, especially in areas
 where the Plankton is poor. For there is great diversity in this respect,
 most of the Mediterranean, for instance, having a scanty Plankton as compared
 with the North Sea. In the South Pacific, west of Patagonia, there is said to
 be an immense &quot;sea desert&quot; where there is little Plankton, and
 therefore little in the way of fishes. The success of fisheries in the North,
 e.g. on the Atlantic cod-banks, is due to the richness of the floating
 sea-meadows and the abundance of the smaller constituents of the animal
 Plankton.</p>

 <p>Hunger is plain enough when the Baleen Whale rushes through the water with
 open jaws, engulfing in the huge cavern of its mouth, where the pendent
 whalebone plates form a huge sieve, incalculable millions of small fry.</p>

 <p>But there is love as well as hunger in the open sea. The maternal care
 exhibited by the whale reaches a very high level, and the delicate shell of
 the female Paper Nautilus or Argonaut, in which the eggs and the young ones
 are sheltered, may well be described as &quot;the most beautiful cradle in
 the world.&quot;</p>

 <p>Besides the permanent inhabitants of the open sea, there are the larval
 stages of many shore-animals which are there only for a short time. For there
 is an interesting give and take between the shore-haunt and the open sea.
 From the shore come nutritive contributions and minute organisms which
 multiply quickly in the open waters. But not less important is the fact that
 the open waters afford a safe cradle or nursery for many a delicate larva,
 e.g. of crab and starfish, acorn-shell and sea-urchin, which could not
 survive for a day in the rough-and-tumble conditions of the<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> shore and the
 shallow water. After undergoing radical changes and gaining strength, the
 young creatures return to the shore in various ways.</p>

 <h3>III. THE DEEP SEA</h3>

 <p>Very different from all the other haunts are the depths of the sea,
 including the floor of the abysses and the zones of water near the bottom.
 This haunt, forever unseen, occupies more than a third of the earth&#39;s
 surface, and it is thickly peopled. It came into emphatic notice in
 connection with the mending of telegraph cables, but the results of the
 <i>Challenger</i> expedition (1873-6) gave the first impressive picture of
 what was practically a new world.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Physical Conditions</h4>

 <p>The average depth of the ocean is about two and a half miles; therefore,
 since many parts are relatively shallow, there must be enormous depths. A few
 of these, technically called &quot;deeps,&quot; are about six miles deep, in
 which Mount Everest would be engulfed. There is enormous pressure in such
 depths; even at 2,500 fathoms it is two and a half tons on the square inch.
 The temperature is on and off the freezing-point of fresh water (28°-34°
 Fahr.), due to the continual sinking down of cold water from the Poles,
 especially from the South. Apart from the fitful gleams of luminescent
 animals, there is utter darkness in the deep waters. The rays of sunlight are
 practically extinguished at 250 fathoms, though very sensitive bromogelatine
 plates exposed at 500 fathoms have shown faint indications even at that
 depth. It is a world of absolute calm and silence, and there is no scenery on
 the floor. A deep, cold, dark, silent, monotonous world!</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Biological Conditions</h4>

 <p>While some parts of the floor of the abysses are more thickly peopled than
 others, there is no depth limit to the distribution of<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> life. Wherever
 the long arm of the dredge has reached, animals have been found, e.g.
 Protozoa, sponges, corals, worms, starfishes, sea-urchins, sea-lilies,
 crustaceans, lamp-shells, molluscs, ascidians, and fishes&mdash;a very
 representative fauna. In the absence of light there can be no
 chlorophyll-possessing plants, and as the animals cannot all be eating one
 another there must be an extraneous source of food-supply. This is found in
 the sinking down of minute organisms which are killed on the surface by
 changes of temperature and other causes. What is left of them, before or
 after being swallowed, and of sea-dust and mineral particles of various kinds
 forms the diversified &quot;ooze&quot; of the sea-floor, a soft muddy
 precipitate, which is said to have in places the consistence of butter in
 summer weather.</p>

 <p>There seems to be no bacteria in the abysses, so there can be no rotting.
 Everything that sinks down, even the huge carcase of a whale, must be nibbled
 away by hungry animals and digested, or else, in the case of most bones,
 slowly dissolved away. Of the whale there are left only the ear-bones, of the
 shark his teeth.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Adaptations to Deep-sea Life</h4>

 <p>In adaptation to the great pressure the bodies of deep-sea animals are
 usually very permeable, so that the water gets through and through them, as
 in the case of Venus&#39; Flower Basket, a flinty sponge which a child&#39;s
 finger would shiver. But when the pressure inside is the same as that outside
 nothing happens. In adaptation to the treacherous ooze, so apt to smother,
 many of the active deep-sea animals have very long, stilt-like legs, and many
 of the sedentary types are lifted into safety on the end of long stalks which
 have their bases embedded in the mud. In adaptation to the darkness, in which
 there is only luminescence that eyes could use, there is a great development
 of tactility. The interesting problem of luminescence will be discussed
 elsewhere.</p>

 <p>As to the origin of the deep-sea fauna, there seems no doubt<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> that it has
 arisen by many contributions from the various shore-haunts. Following the
 down-drifting food, many shore-animals have in the course of many generations
 reached the world of eternal night and winter, and become adapted to its
 strange conditions. For the animals of the deep-sea are as fit, beautiful,
 and vigorous as those elsewhere. There are no slums in Nature.</p>

 <h3>IV. THE FRESH WATERS</h3>

 <p>Of the whole earth&#39;s surface the freshwaters form a very small
 fraction, about a hundredth, but they make up for their smallness by their
 variety. We think of deep lake and shallow pond, of the great river and the
 purling brook, of lagoon and swamp, and more besides. There is a striking
 resemblance in the animal population of widely separated freshwater basins:
 and this is partly because birds carry many small creatures on their muddy
 feet from one water-shed to another; partly because some of the freshwater
 animals are descended from types which make their way from the sea and the
 seashore through estuaries and marshes, and only certain kinds of
 constitution could survive the migration; and partly because some lakes are
 landlocked dwindling relics of ancient seas, and similar forms again would
 survive the change.</p>

 <p>A typical assemblage of freshwater animals would include many Protozoa,
 like Am&oelig;bæ and the Bell-Animalcules, a representative of one family of
 sponges (Spongillidæ), the common Hydra, many unsegmented worms (notably
 Planarians and Nematodes), many Annelids related to the earthworms, many
 crustaceans, insects, and mites, many bivalves and snails, various fishes, a
 newt or two, perhaps a little mud-turtle or in warm countries a huge
 Crocodilian, various interesting birds like the water-ouzel or dipper, and
 mammals like the water-vole and the water-shrew.</p>

 <p>Freshwater animals have to face certain difficulties, the greatest of
 which are drought, frost, and being washed away in<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> times of
 flood. There is no more interesting study in the world than an inquiry into
 the adaptations by which freshwater animals overcome the difficulties of the
 situation. We cannot give more than a few illustrations.</p>

 <p>(1) Drought is circumvented by the capacity that many freshwater animals
 have of lying low and saying nothing. Thus the African mudfish may spend half
 the year encased in the mud, and many minute crustaceans can survive being
 dried up for years. (2) Escape from the danger of being frozen hard in the
 pool is largely due to the almost unique property of water that it expands as
 it approaches the freezing-point. Thus the colder water rises to the surface
 and forms or adds to the protecting blanket of ice. The warmer water remains
 unfrozen at the bottom, and the animals live on. (3) The risk of being washed
 away, e.g. to the sea, is lessened by all sorts of gripping, grappling, and
 anchoring structures, and by shortening the juvenile stages when the risks
 are greatest.</p>

 <h3>V. THE DRY LAND</h3>

 <p>Over and over again in the history of animal life there have been attempts
 to get out of the water on to terra firma, and many of these have been
 successful, notably those made (1) by worms, (2) by air-breathing Arthropods,
 and (3) by amphibians.</p>

 <p>In thinking of the conquest of the dry land by animals, we must recognise
 the indispensable rôle of plants in preparing the way. The dry ground would
 have proved too inhospitable had not terrestrial plants begun to establish
 themselves, affording food, shelter, and humidity. There had to be plants
 before there could be earthworms, which feed on decaying leaves and the like,
 but how soon was the debt repaid when the earthworms began their worldwide
 task of forming vegetable mould, opening up the earth with their burrows,
 circulating the soil by means of their castings, and bruising the particles
 in their gizzard&mdash;certainly the most important mill in the
 world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg
 127]</a></span></p>

 <p>Another important idea is that littoral haunts, both on the seashore and
 in the freshwaters, afforded the necessary apprenticeship and transitional
 experience for the more strenuous life on dry land. Much that was perfected
 on land had its beginnings on the shore. Let us inquire, however, what the
 passage from water to dry land actually implied. This has been briefly
 discussed in a previous article (on Evolution), but the subject is one of
 great interest and importance.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Difficulties and Results of the Transition from Water to
 Land</h4>

 <p>Leaving the water for dry land implied a loss in freedom of movement, for
 the terrestrial animal is primarily restricted to the surface of the earth.
 Thus it became essential that movements should be very rapid and very
 precise, needs with which we may associate the acquisition of fine
 cross-striped, quickly contracting muscles, and also, in time, their
 multiplication into very numerous separate engines. We exercise fifty-four
 muscles in the half-second that elapses between raising the heel of our foot
 in walking and planting it firmly on the ground again. Moreover, the need for
 rapid precisely controlled movements implied an improved nervous system, for
 the brain was a movement-controlling organ for ages before it did much in the
 way of thinking. The transition to terra firma also involved a greater
 compactness of body, so that there should not be too great friction on the
 surface. An animal like the jellyfish is unthinkable on land, and the
 elongated bodies of some land animals like centipedes and snakes are
 specially adapted so that they do not &quot;sprawl.&quot; They are exceptions
 that prove the rule.</p>

 <p>Getting on to dry land meant entering a kingdom where the differences
 between day and night, between summer and winter are more felt than in the
 sea. This made it advantageous to have protections against evaporation and
 loss of heat and other such dangers. Hence a variety of ways in which the
 surface of the body acquired a thickened skin, or a dead cuticle, or a shell,
 or a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg
 128]</a></span> growth of hair, and so forth. In many cases there is an
 increase of the protection before the winter sets in, e.g. by growing thicker
 fur or by accumulating a layer of fat below the skin.</p>

 <p>But the thickening or protection of the skin involved a partial or total
 loss of the skin as a respiratory surface. There is more oxygen available on
 dry land than in the water, but it is not so readily captured. Thus we see
 the importance of moist internal surfaces for capturing the oxygen which has
 been drawn into the interior of the body into some sort of lung. A unique
 solution was offered by Tracheate Arthropods, such as Peripatus, Centipedes,
 Millipedes, and Insects, where the air is carried to every hole and corner of
 the body by a ramifying system of air-tubes or tracheæ. In most animals the
 blood goes to the air, in insects the air goes to the blood. In the
 Robber-Crab, which has migrated from the shore inland, the dry air is
 absorbed by vascular tufts growing under the shelter of the gill-cover.</p>

 <p>The problem of disposing of eggs or young ones is obviously much more
 difficult on land than in the water. For the water offers an immediate
 cradle, whereas on the dry land there were many dangers, e.g. of drought,
 extremes of temperature, and hungry sharp-eyed enemies, which had to be
 circumvented. So we find all manner of ways in which land animals hide their
 eggs or their young ones in holes and nests, on herbs and on trees. Some
 carry their young ones about after they are born, like the Surinam toad and
 the kangaroo, while others have prolonged the period of ante-natal life
 during which the young ones develop in safety within their mother, and in
 very intimate partnership with her in the case of the placental mammals. It
 is very interesting to find that the pioneer animal called Peripatus, which
 bridges the gap between worms and insects, carries its young for almost a
 year before birth.</p>

 <p>Enough has been said to show that the successive conquests of the dry land
 had great evolutionary results. It is hardly too much to say that the
 invasion which the Amphibians led was the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> beginning of better brains, more
 controlled activities, and higher expressions of family life.</p>

  </div>
 </div>

 <h3>VI. THE AIR</h3>

 <p>There are no animals thoroughly aerial, but many insects spend much of
 their adult life in the free air, and the swift hardly pauses in its flight
 from dawn to dusk of the long summer day, alighting only for brief moments at
 the nest to deliver insects to the young. All the active life of bats
 certainly deserves to be called aerial.</p>

 <p>The air was the last haunt of life to be conquered, and it is interesting
 to inquire what the conquest implied. (1) It meant transcending the radical
 difficulty of terrestrial life which confines the creatures of the dry land
 to moving on one plane, the surface of the earth. But the power of flight
 brought its possessors back to the universal freedom of movement which water
 animals enjoy. When we watch a sparrow rise into the air just as the cat has
 completed her stealthy stalking, we see that flight implies an enormous
 increase of safety. (2) The power of flight also opened up new possibilities
 of following the prey, of exploring new territories, of prospecting for
 water. (3) Of great importance too was the practicability of placing the eggs
 and the young, perhaps in a nest, in some place inaccessible to most enemies.
 When one thinks of it, the rooks&#39; nests swaying on the tree-tops express
 the climax of a brilliant experiment. (4) The crowning advantage was the
 possibility of migrating, of conquering time (by circumventing the arid
 summer and the severe winter) and of conquering space (by passing quickly
 from one country to another and sometimes almost girdling the globe). There
 are not many acquisitions that have meant more to their possessors than the
 power of flight. It was a key opening the doors of a new freedom.</p>

 <p>The problem of flight, as has been said in a previous chapter,<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> has been
 solved four times, and the solution has been different in each case. The four
 solutions are those offered by insects, extinct Pterodactyls, birds, and
 bats. Moreover, as has been pointed out, there have been numerous attempts at
 flight which remain glorious failures, notably the flying fishes, which take
 a great leap and hold their pectoral fins taut; the Flying Tree-Toad, whose
 webbed fingers and toes form a parachute; the Flying Lizard (<i>Draco
 volans</i>), which has its skin pushed out on five or six greatly elongated
 mobile ribs; and various &quot;flying&quot; mammals, e.g. Flying Phalangers
 and Flying Squirrels, which take great swooping leaps from tree to tree.</p>

 <p>The wings of an insect are hollow flattened sacs which grow out from the
 upper parts of the sides of the second and third rings of the region called
 the thorax. They are worked by powerful muscles, and are supported, like a
 fan, by ribs of chitin, which may be accompanied by air-tubes,
 blood-channels, and nerves. The insect&#39;s body is lightly built and very
 perfectly aerated, and the principle of the insect&#39;s flight is the
 extremely rapid striking of the air by means of the lightly built elastic
 wings. Many an insect has over two hundred strokes of its wings in one
 <i>second</i>. Hence, in many cases, the familiar hum, comparable on a small
 scale to that produced by the rapidly revolving blades of an aeroplane&#39;s
 propeller. For a short distance a bee can outfly a pigeon, but few insects
 can fly far, and they are easily blown away or blown back by the wind.
 Dragon-flies and bees may be cited as examples of insects that often fly for
 two or three miles. But this is exceptional, and the usual shortness of
 insect flight is an important fact for man since it limits the range of
 insects like house-flies and mosquitoes which are vehicles of typhoid fever
 and malaria respectively. The most primitive insects (spring-tails and
 bristle-tails) show no trace of wings, while fleas and lice have become
 secondarily wingless. It is interesting to notice that some insects only fly
 once in their lifetime, namely, in connection with mating. The evolution of
 the insect&#39;s wing remains quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131"
 id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> obscure, but it is probable that insects
 could run, leap, and parachute before they could actually fly.</p>

 <p>The extinct Flying Dragons or Pterodactyls had their golden age in the
 Cretaceous era, after which they disappeared, leaving no descendants. A fold
 of skin was spread out from the sides of the body by the enormously elongated
 outermost finger (usually regarded as corresponding to our little finger); it
 was continued to the hind-legs and thence to the tail.</p>

 <p>It is unlikely that the Pterodactyls could fly far, for they have at most
 a weak keel on their breast-bone; on the other hand, some of them show a
 marked fusion of dorsal vertebræ, which, as in flying birds, must have served
 as a firm fulcrum for the stroke of the wings. The quaint creatures varied
 from the size of a sparrow up to a magnificent spread of 15-20 feet from tip
 to tip of the wings. They were the largest of all flying creatures.</p>

 <p>The bird&#39;s solution of the problem of flight, which will be discussed
 separately, is centred in the feather, which forms a coherent vane for
 striking the air. In Pterodactyl and bat the wing is a web-wing or patagium,
 and a small web is to be seen on the front side of the bird&#39;s wing. But
 the bird&#39;s patagium is unimportant, and the bird&#39;s wing is on an
 evolutionary tack of its own&mdash;a fore-limb transformed for bearing the
 feathers of flight. Feathers are in a general way comparable to the scales of
 reptiles, but only in a general way, and no transition stage is known between
 the two. Birds evolved from a bipedal Dinosaur stock, as has been noticed
 already, and it is highly probable that they began their ascent by taking
 running leaps along the ground, flapping their scaly fore-limbs, and
 balancing themselves in kangaroo-like fashion with an extended tail. A second
 chapter was probably an arboreal apprenticeship, during which they made a
 fine art of parachuting&mdash;a persistence of which is to be seen in the
 pigeon &quot;gliding&quot; from the dovecot to the ground. It is in birds
 that the mastery of the air reaches its climax, and the mysterious
 &quot;sailing&quot; of the albatross and the vulture is surely the
 most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg
 132]</a></span> remarkable locomotor triumph that has ever been achieved.
 Without any apparent stroke of the wings, the bird sails for half an hour at
 a time with the wind and against the wind, around the ship and in majestic
 spirals in the sky, probably taking advantage of currents of air of different
 velocities, and continually changing energy of position into energy of motion
 as it sinks, and energy of motion into energy of position as it rises. It is
 interesting to know that some dragon-flies are also able to
 &quot;sail.&quot;</p>

 <p>The web-wing of bats involves much more than the fore-arm. The double fold
 of skin begins on the side of the neck, passes along the front of the arm,
 skips the thumb, and is continued over the elongated palm-bones and fingers
 to the sides of the body again, and to the hind-legs, and to the tail if
 there is a tail. It is interesting to find that the bones of the bat&#39;s
 skeleton tend to be lightly built as in birds, that the breast-bone has
 likewise a keel for the better insertion of the pectoral muscles, and that
 there is a solidifying of the vertebræ of the back, affording as in birds a
 firm basis for the wing action. Such similar adaptations to similar needs,
 occurring in animals not nearly related to one another, are called
 &quot;convergences,&quot; and form a very interesting study. In addition to
 adaptations which the bat shares with the flying bird, it has many of its
 own. There are so many nerve-endings on the wing, and often also on special
 skin-leaves about the ears and nose, that the bat flying in the dusk does not
 knock against branches or other obstacles. Some say that it is helped by the
 echoes of its high-pitched voice, but there is no doubt as to its exquisite
 tactility. That it usually produces only a single young one at a time is a
 clear adaptation to flight, and similarly the sharp, mountain-top-like cusps
 on the back teeth are adapted in insectivorous bats for crunching
 insects.</p>

 <p>Whether we think of the triumphant flight of birds, reaching a climax in
 migration, or of the marvel that a creature of the earth&mdash;as a mammal
 essentially is&mdash;should evolve such a mastery of the air as we see in
 bats, or even of the repeated but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id=
 "Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> splendid failures which parachuting animals
 illustrate, we gain an impression of the insurgence of living creatures in
 their characteristic endeavour after fuller well-being.</p>

 <p>We have said enough to show how well adapted many animals are to meet the
 particular difficulties of the haunt which they tenant. But difficulties and
 limitations are ever arising afresh, and so one fitness follows on another.
 It is natural, therefore, to pass to the frequent occurrence of protective
 resemblance, camouflage, and mimicry&mdash;the subject of the next
 article.</p>

 <h3>ANIMAL AND BIRD MIMICRY AND DISGUISE</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <p>For every animal one discovers when observing carefully, there must be ten
 unseen. This is partly because many animals burrow in the ground or get in
 underneath things and into dark corners, being what is called cryptozoic or
 elusive. But it is partly because many animals put on disguise or have in
 some way acquired a garment of invisibility. This is very common among
 animals, and it occurs in many forms and degrees. The reason why it is so
 common is because the struggle for existence is often very keen, and the
 reasons why the struggle for existence is keen are four. First, there is the
 tendency to over-population in many animals, especially those of low degree.
 Second, there is the fact that the scheme of nature involves nutritive chains
 or successive incarnations, one animal depending upon another for food, and
 all in the long run on plants; thirdly, every vigorous animal is a bit of a
 hustler, given to insurgence and sticking out his elbows. There is a fourth
 great reason for the struggle for existence, namely, the frequent
 changefulness of the physical environment, which forces animals to answer
 back or die; but the first three reasons have most to do with the very common
 assumption of some sort of disguise. Even when an animal is in no sense a
 weakling, it may be very advantageous for it to be inconspicuous when it is
 resting or when it is taking care of its young. Our problem is the evolution
 of elusiveness, so far at least as that depends on likeness to surroundings,
 on protective resemblance to other objects, and in its highest reaches on
 true mimicry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg

 <h4 class="sect">Colour Permanently Like That of Surroundings</h4>

 <p>Many animals living on sandy places have a light-brown colour, as is seen
 in some lizards and snakes. The green lizard is like the grass and the green
 tree-snake is inconspicuous among the branches. The spotted leopard is suited
 to the interrupted light of the forest, and it is sometimes hard to tell
 where the jungle ends and the striped tiger begins. There is no better case
 than the hare or the partridge sitting a few yards off on the ploughed field.
 Even a donkey grazing in the dusk is much more readily heard than seen.</p>

 <p>The experiment has been made of tethering the green variety of Praying
 Mantis on green herbage, fastening them with silk threads. They escape the
 notice of birds. The same is true when the brown variety is tethered on
 withered herbage. But if the green ones are put on brown plants, or the brown
 ones on green plants, the birds pick them off. Similarly, out of 300 chickens
 in a field, 240 white or black and therefore conspicuous, 60 spotted and
 inconspicuous, 24 were soon picked off by crows, but only one of these was
 spotted. This was not the proportion that there should have been if the
 mortality had been fortuitous. There is no doubt that it often pays an animal
 to be like its habitual surroundings, like a little piece of scenery if the
 animal is not moving. It is safe to say that in process of time wide
 departures from the safest coloration will be wiped out in the course of
 Nature&#39;s ceaseless sifting.</p>

 <p>But we must not be credulous, and there are three cautions to be borne in
 mind. (1) An animal may be very like its surroundings without there being any
 protection implied. The arrow-worms in the sea are as clear as glass, and so
 are many open-sea animals. But this is because their tissues are so watery,
 with a specific gravity near that of the salt water. And the invisibility
 does not save them, always or often, from being swallowed by larger animals
 that gather the harvest of the sea. (2) Among the cleverer animals it looks
 as if the creature sometimes sought out a spot where it was most
 inconspicuous. A spider may place itself<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> in the middle of a little patch
 of lichen, where its self-effacement is complete. Perhaps it is more
 comfortable as well as safer to rest in surroundings the general colour of
 which is like that of the animal&#39;s body. (3) The fishes that live among
 the coral-reefs are startling in their brilliant coloration, and there are
 many different patterns. To explain this it has been suggested that these
 fishes are so safe among the mazy passages and endless nooks of the reefs,
 that they can well afford to wear any colour that suits their constitution.
 In some cases this may be true, but naturalists who have put on a diving suit
 and walked about among the coral have told us that each kind of fish is
 particularly suited to some particular place, and that some are suited for
 midday work and others for evening work. Sometimes there is a sort of Box and
 Cox arrangement by which two different fishes utilise the same corner at
 different times.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Gradual Change of Colour</h4>

 <p>The common shore-crab shows many different colours and mottlings,
 especially when it is young. It may be green or grey, red or brown, and so
 forth, and it is often in admirable adjustment to the colour of the rock-pool
 where it is living. Experiments, which require extension, have shown that
 when the crab has moulted, which it has to do very often when it is young,
 the colour of the new shell tends to harmonise with the general colour of the
 rocks and seaweed. How this is brought about, we do not know. The colour does
 not seem to change till the next moult, and not then unless there is some
 reason for it. A full-grown shore-crab is well able to look after itself, and
 it is of interest to notice, therefore, that the variety of coloration is
 mainly among the small individuals, who have, of course, a much less secure
 position. It is possible, moreover, that the resemblance to the surroundings
 admits of more successful hunting, enabling the small crab to take its victim
 unawares.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg
 140]</a></span></p>

 <p>Professor Poulton&#39;s experiments with the caterpillars of the small
 tortoise-shell butterfly showed that in black surroundings the pupæ tend to
 be darker, in white surroundings lighter, in gilded boxes golden; and the
 same is true in other cases. It appears that the surrounding colour affects
 the caterpillars through the skin during a sensitive period&mdash;the twenty
 hours immediately preceding the last twelve hours of the larval state. The
 result will tend to make the quiescent pupæ less conspicuous during the
 critical time of metamorphosis. The physiology of this sympathetic colouring
 remains obscure.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Seasonal Change of Colouring</h4>

 <p>The ptarmigan moults three times in the year. Its summer plumage is rather
 grouselike above, with a good deal of rufous brown; the back becomes much
 more grey in autumn; almost all the feathers of the winter plumage are white.
 That is to say, they develop without any pigment and with numerous
 gas-bubbles in their cells. Now there can be no doubt that this white winter
 plumage makes the ptarmigan very inconspicuous amidst the snow. Sometimes one
 comes within a few feet of the crouching bird without seeing it, and this
 garment of invisibility may save it from the hungry eyes of golden
 eagles.</p>

 <p>Similarly the brown stoat becomes the white ermine, mainly by the growth,
 of a new suit of white fur, and the same is true of the mountain hare. The
 ermine is all white except the black tip of its tail; the mountain hare in
 its winter dress is all white save the black tips of its ears. In some cases,
 especially in the mountain hare, it seems that individual hairs may turn
 white, by a loss of pigment, as may occur in man. According to Metchnikoff,
 the wandering am&oelig;boid cells of the body, called phagocytes, may creep
 up into the hairs and come back again with microscopic burdens of pigment.
 The place of the pigment is taken by gas-bubbles, and that is what causes the
 whiteness. In no animals is there any white <i>pigment</i>; the white
 <i>colour</i> is like that of snow or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141"
 id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> foam, it is due to the complete reflection
 of the light from innumerable minute surfaces of crystals or bubbles.</p>

 <p>The mountain hare may escape the fox the more readily because its
 whiteness makes it so inconspicuous against a background of snow; and yet, at
 other times, we have seen the creature standing out like a target on the dark
 moorland. So it cuts both ways. The ermine has almost no enemies except the
 gamekeeper, but its winter whiteness may help it to sneak upon its victims,
 such as grouse or rabbit, when there is snow upon the ground. In both cases,
 however, the probability is that the constitutional rhythm which leads to
 white hair in winter has been fostered and fixed for a reason quite apart
 from protection. The fact is that for a warm-blooded creature, whether bird
 or mammal, the physiologically best dress is a white one, for there is less
 radiation of the precious animal heat from white plumage or white pelage than
 from any other colour. The quality of warm-bloodedness is a prerogative of
 birds and mammals, and it means that the body keeps an almost constant
 temperature, day and night, year in and year out. This is effected by
 automatic internal adjustments which regulate the supply of heat, chiefly
 from the muscles, to the loss of heat, chiefly through the skin and from the
 lungs. The chief importance of this internal heat is that it facilitates the
 smooth continuance of the chemical processes on which life depends. If the
 temperature falls, as in hibernating mammals (whose warm-bloodedness is
 imperfect), the rate of the vital process is slowed down&mdash;sometimes
 dangerously. Thus we see how the white coat helps the life of the
 creature.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 3</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Rapid Colour-change</h4>

 <p>Bony flat-fishes, like plaice and sole, have a remarkable power of
 adjusting their hue and pattern to the surrounding gravel and sand, so that
 it is difficult to find them even when we know that they are there. It must
 be admitted that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id=
 "Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> are also very quick to get a sprinkling of
 sand over their upturned side, so that only the eyes are left showing. But
 there is no doubt as to the exactness with which they often adjust themselves
 to be like a little piece of the substratum on which they lie; they will do
 this within limits in experimental conditions when they are placed on a quite
 artificial floor. As these fishes are very palatable and are much sought
 after by such enemies as cormorants and otters, it is highly probably that
 their power of self-effacement often saves their life. And it may be effected
 within a few minutes, in some cases within a minute.</p>

 <p>In these self-effacing flat-fishes we know with some precision what
 happens. The adjustment of colour and pattern is due to changes in the size,
 shape, and position of mobile pigment-cells (chromatophores) and the skin.
 But what makes the pigment-cells change? The fact that a blind flat-fish does
 not change its colour gives us the first part of the answer. The colour and
 the pattern of the surroundings must affect the eye. The message travels by
 the optic nerve to the brain; from the brain, instead of passing down the
 spinal cord, the message travels down the chain of sympathetic ganglia. From
 these it passes along the nerves which comes out of the spinal cord and
 control the skin. Thus the message reaches the colour-cells in the skin, and
 before you have carefully read these lines the flat-fish has slipped on its
 Gyges ring and become invisible.</p>

 <p>The same power of rapid colour-change is seen in cuttlefishes, where it is
 often an expression of nervous excitement, though it sometimes helps to
 conceal. It occurs with much subtlety in the Æsop prawn, Hippolyte, which may
 be brown on a brown seaweed, green on sea-lettuce or sea-grass, red on red
 seaweed, and so on through an extensive repertory.</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>According to the nature of the background, [Professor Gamble writes] so
  is the mixture of the pigments compounded so as to form a close reproduction
  both of its colour and its pattern. A sweep of the shrimp net detaches a
  battalion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg
  143]</a></span> of these sleeping prawns, and if we turn the motley into a
  dish and give a choice of seaweed, each variety after its kind will select
  the one with which it agrees in colour, and vanish. Both when young and when
  full-grown, the Æsop prawn takes on the colour of its immediate
  surroundings. At nightfall Hippolyte, of whatever colour, changes to a
  transparent azure blue: its stolidity gives place to a nervous restlessness;
  at the least tremor it leaps violently, and often swims actively from one
  food-plant to another. This blue fit lasts till daybreak, and is then
  succeeded by the prawn&#39;s diurnal tint.</p>
 </div>

 <p>Thus, Professor Gamble continues, the colour of an animal may express a
 nervous rhythm.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Case of Chameleons</h4>

 <p>The highest level at which rapid colour-change occurs is among lizards,
 and the finest exhibition of it is among the chameleons. These quaint
 creatures are characteristic of Africa; but they occur also in Andalusia,
 Arabia, Ceylon, and Southern India. They are adapted for life on trees, where
 they hunt insects with great deliberateness and success. The protrusible
 tongue, ending in a sticky club, can be shot out for about seven inches in
 the common chameleon. Their hands and feet are split so that they grip the
 branches firmly, and the prehensile tail rivals a monkey&#39;s. When they
 wish they can make themselves very slim, contracting the body from side to
 side, so that they are not very readily seen. In other circumstances,
 however, they do not practise self-effacement, but the very reverse. They
 inflate their bodies, having not only large lungs, but air-sacs in connection
 with them. The throat bulges; the body sways from side to side; and the
 creature expresses its sentiments in a hiss. The power of colour-change is
 very remarkable, and depends partly on the contraction and expansion of the
 colour-cells (chromatophores) in the under-skin (or dermis) and partly on
 close-packed refractive granules and crystals of a waste-product called
 guanin. The repertory of possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id=
 "Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> colours in the common chameleon is greater
 than in any other animal except the Æsop prawn. There is a legend of a
 chameleon which was brown in a brown box, green in a green box, and blue in a
 blue box, and died when put into one lined with tartan; and there is no doubt
 that one and the same animal has a wide range of colours. The so-called
 &quot;chameleon&quot; (<i>Anolis</i>) of North America is so sensitive that a
 passing cloud makes it change its emerald hue.</p>

 <p>There is no doubt that a chameleon may make itself more inconspicuous by
 changing its colour, being affected by the play of light on its eyes. A
 bright-green hue is often seen on those that are sitting among strongly
 illumined green leaves. But the colour also changes with the time of day and
 with the animal&#39;s moods. A sudden irritation may bring about a rapid
 change; in other cases the transformation comes about very gradually. When
 the colour-change expresses the chameleon&#39;s feelings it might be compared
 to blushing, but that is due to an expansion of the arteries of the face,
 allowing more blood to get into the capillaries of the under-skin. The case
 of the chameleon is peculiarly interesting because the animal has two kinds
 of tactics&mdash;self-effacement on the one hand and bluffing on the other.
 There can be little doubt that the power of colour-change sometimes justifies
 itself by driving off intruders. Dr. Cyril Crossland observed that a
 chameleon attacked by a fox-terrier &quot;turned round and opened its great
 pink mouth in the face of the advancing dog, at the same time rapidly
 changing colour, becoming almost black. This ruse succeeded every time, the
 dog turning off at once.&quot; In natural leafy surroundings the startling
 effect would be much greater&mdash;a sudden throwing off of the mantle of
 invisibility and the exposure of a conspicuous black body with a large red
 mouth.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 4</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Likeness to Other Things</h4>

 <p>Dr. H. O. Forbes tells of a flat spider which presents a striking
 resemblance to a bird&#39;s dropping on a leaf. Years after he<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> first found it
 he was watching in a forest in the Far East when his eye fell on a leaf
 before him which had been blotched by a bird. He wondered idly why he had not
 seen for so long another specimen of the bird-dropping spider
 (<i>Ornithoscatoides decipiens</i>), and drew the leaf towards him.
 Instantaneously he got a characteristic sharp nip; it was the spider after
 all! Here the colour-resemblance was enhanced by a form-resemblance.</p>

  </div>
 </div>

 <p>But why should it profit a spider to be like a bird-dropping? Perhaps
 because it thereby escapes attention; but there is another possibility. It
 seems that some butterflies, allied to our Blues, are often attracted to
 excrementitious material, and the spider Dr. Forbes observed had actually
 caught its victim. This is borne out by a recent observation by Dr. D. G. H.
 Carpenter, who found a Uganda bug closely resembling a bird-dropping on sand.
 The bug actually settled down on a bird-dropping on sand, and caught a blue
 butterfly which came to feed there!</p>

 <p>Some of the walking-stick insects, belonging to the order of crickets and
 grasshoppers (Orthoptera), have their body elongated and narrow, like a thin
 dry branch, and they have a way of sticking out their limbs at abrupt and
 diverse angles, which makes the resemblance to twigs very close indeed. Some
 of these quaint insects rest through the day and have the remarkable habit of
 putting themselves into a sort of kataleptic state. Many creatures turn stiff
 when they get a shock, or pass suddenly into new surroundings, like some of
 the sand-hoppers when we lay them on the palm of our hand; but these
 twig-insects put themselves into this strange state. The body is rocked from
 side to side for a short time, and then it stiffens. An advantage may be that
 even if they were surprised by a bird or a lizard, they will not be able to
 betray themselves by even a tremor. Disguise is perfected by a remarkable
 habit, a habit which leads us to think of a whole series of different ways of
 lying low and saying nothing which are often of life-preserving value. The
 top end of the series is seen when a fox plays &#39;possum.<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

 <p>The leaf-butterfly <i>Kallima</i>, conspicuously coloured on its upper
 surface, is like a withered leaf when it settles down and shows the under
 side of its wings. Here, again, there is precise form-resemblance, for the
 nervures on the wings are like the mid-rib and side veins on a leaf, and the
 touch of perfection is given in the presence of whitish spots which look
 exactly like the discolorations produced by lichens on leaves. An old
 entomologist, Mr. Jenner Weir, confessed that he repeatedly pruned off a
 caterpillar on a bush in mistake for a superfluous twig, for many brownish
 caterpillars fasten themselves by their posterior claspers and by an
 invisible thread of silk from their mouth, and project from the branch at a
 twig-like angle. An insect may be the very image of a sharp prickle or a
 piece of soft moss; a spider may look precisely like a tiny knob on a branch
 or a fragment of lichen; one of the sea-horses (<i>Phyllopteryx</i>) has
 frond-like tassels on various parts of its body, so that it looks
 extraordinarily like the seaweeds among which it lives. In a few cases, e.g.
 among spiders, it has been shown that animals with a special protective
 resemblance to something else seek out a position where this resemblance
 tells, and there is urgent need for observations bearing on this selection of
 environment.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 5</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Mimicry in the True Sense</h4>

 <p>It sometimes happens that in one and the same place there are two groups
 of animals not very nearly related which are &quot;doubles&quot; of one
 another. Investigation shows that the members of the one group, <i>always in
 the majority</i>, are in some way specially protected, e.g. by being
 unpalatable. They are the &quot;mimicked.&quot; The members of the other
 group, <i>always in the minority</i>, have not got the special protection
 possessed by the others. They are the &quot;mimickers,&quot; though the
 resemblance is not, of course, associated with any conscious imitation. The
 theory is that the mimickers live on the reputation of the mimicked. If the
 mimicked are left alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id=
 "Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> by birds because they have a reputation for
 unpalatability, or because they are able to sting, the mimickers
 survive&mdash;although they are palatable and stingless. They succeed, not
 through any virtue of their own, but because of their resemblance to the
 mimicked, for whom they are mistaken. There are many cases of mimetic
 resemblance so striking and so subtle that it seems impossible to doubt that
 the thing works; there are other cases which are rather far-fetched, and may
 be somewhat of the nature of coincidences. Thus although Mr. Bates tells us
 that he repeatedly shot humming-bird moths in mistake for humming-birds, we
 cannot think that this is a good illustration of mimicry. What is needed for
 many cases is what is forthcoming for some, namely, experimental evidence,
 e.g. that the unpalatable mimicked butterflies are left in relative peace
 while similar palatable butterflies are persecuted. It is also necessary to
 show that the mimickers do actually consort with the mimicked. Some beetles
 and moths are curiously wasplike, which may be a great advantage; the common
 drone-fly is superficially like a small bee; some harmless snakes are very
 like poisonous species; and Mr. Wallace maintained that the powerful
 &quot;friar-birds&quot; of the Far East are mimicked by the weak and timid
 orioles. When the model is unpalatable or repulsive or dangerous, and the
 mimic the reverse, the mimicry is called &quot;Batesian&quot; (after Mr.
 Bates), but there is another kind of mimicry called Müllerian (after Fritz
 Müller) where the mimic is also unpalatable. The theory in this case is that
 the mimicry serves as mutual assurance, the members of the ring getting on
 better by consistently presenting the same appearance, which has come to mean
 to possible enemies a signal, <i>Noli me tangere</i> (&quot;Leave me
 alone&quot;). There is nothing out of the question in this theory, but it
 requires to be taken in a critical spirit. It leads us to think of
 &quot;warning colours,&quot; which are the very opposite of the disguises
 which we are now studying. Some creatures like skunks, magpies, coral-snakes,
 cobras, brightly coloured tree-frogs are obtrusive rather<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> than elusive,
 and the theory of Alfred Russel Wallace was that the flaunting
 conspicuousness serves as a useful advertisement, impressing itself on the
 memories of inexperienced enemies, who soon learn to leave creatures with
 &quot;warning colours&quot; alone. In any case it is plain that an animal
 which is as safe as a wasp or a coral-snake can afford to wear any suit of
 clothes it likes.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Masking</h4>

 <p>The episode in Scottish history called &quot;The Walking Wood of
 Birnam,&quot; when the advancing troop masked their approach by cutting down
 branches of the trees, has had its counterpart in many countries. But it is
 also enacted on the seashore. There are many kinds of crabs that put on
 disguise with what looks like deliberateness. The sand-crab takes a piece of
 seaweed, nibbles at the end of it, and then rubs it on the back of the
 carapace or on the legs so that it fixes to the bristles. As the seaweed
 continues to live, the crab soon has a little garden on its back which masks
 the crab&#39;s real nature. It is most effective camouflaging, but if the
 crab continues to grow it has to moult, and that means losing the disguise.
 It is then necessary to make a new one. The crab must have on the shore
 something corresponding to a reputation; that is to say, other animals are
 clearly or dimly aware that the crab is a voracious and combative creature.
 How useful to the crab, then, to have its appearance cloaked by a growth of
 innocent seaweed, or sponge, or zoophyte. It will enable the creature to
 sneak upon its victims or to escape the attention of its own enemies.</p>

 <p>If a narrow-beaked crab is cleaned artificially it will proceed to clothe
 itself again, the habit has become instinctive; and it must be admitted that
 while a particular crab prefers a particular kind of seaweed for its dress,
 it will cover itself with unsuitable and even conspicuous material, such as
 pieces of coloured cloth, if nothing better is available. The disguise
 differs greatly, for one crab is masked by a brightly coloured and
 unpalatable sponge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg
 149]</a></span> densely packed with flinty needles; another cuts off the
 tunic of a sea-squirt and throws it over its shoulders; another trundles
 about a bivalve shell. The facts recall the familiar case of the hermit-crab,
 which protects its soft tail by tucking it into the empty shell of a
 periwinkle or a whelk or some other sea-snail, and that case leads on to the
 elaboration known as commensalism, where the hermit-crab fixes sea-anemones
 on the back of its borrowed house. The advantage here is beyond that of
 masking, for the sea-anemone can sting, which is a useful quality in a
 partner. That this second advantage may become the main one is evident in
 several cases where the sea-anemone is borne, just like a weapon, on each of
 the crustacean&#39;s great claws. Moreover, as the term commensalism (eating
 at the same table) suggests, the partnership is <i>mutually</i> beneficial.
 For the sea-anemone is carried about by the hermit-crab, and it doubtless
 gets its share of crumbs from its partner&#39;s frequent meals. There is a
 very interesting sidelight on the mutual benefit in the case of a dislodged
 sea-anemone which sulked for a while and then waited in a state of
 preparedness until a hermit-crab passed by and touched it. Whereupon the
 sea-anemone gripped and slowly worked itself up on to the back of the
 shell.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 6</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Other Kinds of Elusiveness</h4>

 <p>There are various kinds of disguise which are not readily classified. A
 troop of cuttlefish swimming in the sea is a beautiful sight. They keep time
 with one another in their movements and they show the same change of colour
 almost at the same moment. They are suddenly attacked, however, by a small
 shark, and then comes a simultaneous discharge of sepia from their ink-bags.
 There are clouds of ink in the clear water, for, as Professor Hickson puts
 it, the cuttlefishes have thrown dust in the eyes of their enemies. One can
 see a newborn cuttlefish do this a minute after it escapes from the
 egg.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg
 150]</a></span></p>

 <p>Very beautiful is the way in which many birds, like our common chaffinch,
 disguise the outside of their nest with moss and lichen and other trifles
 felted together, so that the cradle is as inconspicuous as possible. There
 seems to be a touch of art in fastening pieces of spider&#39;s web on the
 outside of a nest!</p>

 <p>How curious is the case of the tree-sloth of South American forests, that
 walks slowly, back downwards, along the undersides of the branches, hanging
 on by its long, curved fingers and toes. It is a nocturnal animal, and
 therefore not in special danger, but when resting during the day it is almost
 invisible because its shaggy hair is so like certain lichens and other
 growths on the branches. But the protective resemblance is enhanced by the
 presence of a green alga, which actually lives on the surface of the
 sloth&#39;s hairs&mdash;an alga like the one that makes tree-stems and
 gate-posts green in damp weather.</p>

 <p>There is no commoner sight in the early summer than the cuckoo-spit on the
 grasses and herbage by the wayside. It is conspicuous and yet it is said to
 be left severely alone by almost all creatures. In some way it must be a
 disguise. It is a sort of soap made by the activity of small frog-hoppers
 while they are still in the wingless larval stage, before they begin to hop.
 The insect pierces with its sharp mouth-parts the skin of the plant and sucks
 in sweet sap which by and by overflows over its body. It works its body up
 and down many times, whipping in air, which mixes with the sugary sap,
 reminding one of how &quot;whipped egg&quot; is made. But along with the
 sugary sap and the air, there is a little ferment from the food-canal and a
 little wax from glands on the skin, and the four things mixed together make a
 kind of soap which lasts through the heat of the day.</p>

 <p>There are many other modes of disguise besides those which we have been
 able to illustrate. Indeed, the biggest fact is that there are so many, for
 it brings us back to the idea that life is not an easy business. It is true,
 as Walt Whitman says, that animals do not sweat and whine about their
 condition; perhaps it is true,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id=
 "Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> as he says, that not one is unhappy over the
 whole earth. But there is another truth, that this world is not a place for
 the unlit lamp and the ungirt loin, and that when a creature has not armour
 or weapons or cleverness it must find some path of safety or go back. One of
 these paths of safety is disguise, and we have illustrated its
 evolution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg

 <h2>THE ASCENT OF MAN</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>THE ASCENT OF MAN</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <p>No one thinks less of Sir Isaac Newton because he was born as a very puny
 infant, and no one should think less of the human race because it sprang from
 a stock of arboreal mammals. There is no doubt as to man&#39;s apartness from
 the rest of creation when he is seen at his best&mdash;&quot;a little lower
 than the angels, crowned with glory and honour.&quot; &quot;What a piece of
 work is a man! How noble in reason! How infinite in faculty! in form and
 moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in
 apprehension so like a God.&quot; Nevertheless, all the facts point to his
 affiliation to the stock to which monkeys and apes also belong. Not, indeed,
 that man is descended from any living ape or monkey; it is rather that he and
 they have sprung from a common ancestry&mdash;are branches of the same stem.
 This conclusion is so momentous that the reasons for accepting it must be
 carefully considered. They were expounded with masterly skill in Darwin&#39;s
 <i>Descent of Man</i> in 1871&mdash;a book which was but an expansion of a
 chapter in <i>The Origin of Species</i> (1859).</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Anatomical Proof of Man&#39;s Relationship with a Simian
 Stock</h4>

 <p>The anatomical structure of man is closely similar to that of the
 anthropoid apes&mdash;the gorilla, the orang, the chimpanzee, and the gibbon.
 Bone for bone, muscle for muscle, blood-vessel for blood-vessel, nerve for
 nerve, man and ape agree. As the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id=
 "Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> conservative anatomist, Sir Richard Owen,
 said, there is between them &quot;an all-pervading similitude of
 structure.&quot; Differences, of course, there are, but they are not
 momentous except man&#39;s big brain, which may be three times as heavy as
 that of a gorilla. The average human brain weighs about 48 ounces; the
 gorilla brain does not exceed 20 ounces at its best. The capacity of the
 human skull is never less than 55 cubic inches; in the orang and the
 chimpanzee the figures are 26 and 27½ respectively. We are not suggesting
 that the most distinctive features of man are such as can be measured and
 weighed, but it is important to notice that the main seat of his mental
 powers is physically far ahead of that of the highest of the anthropoid
 apes.</p>

 <p>Man alone is thoroughly erect after his infancy is past; his head weighted
 with the heavy brain does not droop forward as the ape&#39;s does; with his
 erect attitude there is perhaps to be associated his more highly developed
 vocal organs. Compared with an anthropoid ape, man has a bigger and more
 upright forehead, a less protrusive face region, smaller cheek-bones and
 eyebrow ridges, and more uniform teeth. He is almost unique in having a chin.
 Man plants the sole of his foot flat on the ground, his big toe is usually in
 a line with the other toes, and he has a better heel than any monkey has. The
 change in the shape of the head is to be thought of in connection with the
 enlargement of the brain, and also in connection with the natural reduction
 of the muzzle region when the hand was freed from being an organ of support
 and became suited for grasping the food and conveying it to the mouth.</p>

 <p>Everyone is familiar in man&#39;s clothing with traces of the past
 persisting in the present, though their use has long since disappeared. There
 are buttons on the back of the waist of the morning coat to which the tails
 of the coat used to be fastened up, and there are buttons, occasionally with
 buttonholes, at the wrist which were once useful in turning up the sleeve.
 The same is true of man&#39;s body, which is a veritable museum of relics.
 Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg
 157]</a></span> anatomists have made out a list of over a hundred of these
 <i>vestigial</i> structures, and though this number is perhaps too high,
 there is no doubt that the list is long. In the inner upper corner of the eye
 there is a minute tag&mdash;but larger in some races than in
 others&mdash;which is the last dwindling relic of the third eyelid, used in
 cleaning the front of the eye, which most mammals possess in a large and
 well-developed form. It can be easily seen, for instance, in ox and rabbit.
 In man and in monkeys it has become a useless vestige, and the dwindling must
 be associated with the fact that the upper eyelid is much more mobile in man
 and monkeys than in the other mammals. The vestigial third eyelid in man is
 enough of itself to prove his relationship with the mammals, but it is only
 one example out of many. Some of these are discussed in the article dealing
 with the human body, but we may mention the vestigial muscles going to the
 ear-trumpet, man&#39;s dwindling counterpart of the skin-twitching muscle
 which we see a horse use when he jerks a fly off his flanks, and the short
 tail which in the seven-weeks-old human embryo is actually longer than the
 leg. Without committing ourselves to a belief in the entire uselessness of
 the vermiform appendix, which grows out as a blind alley at the junction of
 the small intestine with the large, we are safe in saying that it is a
 dwindling structure&mdash;the remains of a blind gut which must have been
 capacious and useful in ancestral forms. In some mammals, like the rabbit,
 the blind gut is the bulkiest structure in the body, and bears the vermiform
 appendix at its far end. In man the appendix alone is left, and it tells its
 tale. It is interesting to notice that it is usually longer in the orang than
 in man, and that it is very variable, as dwindling structures tend to be. One
 of the unpleasant expressions of this variability is the liability to go
 wrong: hence appendicitis. Now these vestigial structures are, as Darwin
 said, like the unsounded, i.e. functionless, letters in words, such as the
 <i>o</i> in &quot;leopard,&quot; the <i>b</i> in &quot;doubt,&quot; the
 <i>g</i> in &quot;reign.&quot; They are of no use, but they tell us something
 of the history of the words. So do man&#39;s vestigial<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> structures
 reveal his pedigree. They must have an historical or evolutionary
 significance. No other interpretation is possible.</p>

 <p>Some men, oftener than women, show on the inturned margin of the

 vestige of the tip of the pointed ear of lower mammals, and it is well named
 <i>Darwin&#39;s point</i>. It was he who described it as a &quot;surviving
 symbol of the stirring times and dangerous days of man&#39;s animal
 youth.&quot;</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Physiological Proof of Man&#39;s Relationship with a Simian
 Stock</h4>

 <p>The everyday functions of the human body are practically the same as those
 of the anthropoid ape, and similar disorders are common to both. Monkeys may
 be infected with certain microbes to which man is peculiarly liable, such as
 the bacillus of tuberculosis. Darwin showed that various human gestures and
 facial expressions have their counterparts in monkeys. The sneering curl of
 the upper lip, which tends to expose the canine tooth, is a case in point,
 though it may be seen in many other mammals besides monkeys&mdash;in dogs,
 for instance, which are at some considerable distance from the simian branch
 to which man&#39;s ancestors belonged.</p>

 <p>When human blood is transfused into a dog or even a monkey, it behaves in
 a hostile way to the other blood, bringing about a destruction of the red
 blood corpuscles. But when it is transfused into a chimpanzee there is an
 harmonious mingling of the two. This is a very literal demonstration of
 man&#39;s blood-relationship with the higher apes. But there is a finer form
 of the same experiment. When the blood-fluid (or serum) of a rabbit, which
 has had human blood injected into it, is mingled with human blood, it forms a
 cloudy precipitate. It forms almost as marked a precipitate when it is
 mingled with the blood of an anthropoid ape. But when it is mingled with the
 blood of an American monkey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id=
 "Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> there is only a slight clouding after a
 considerable time and no actual precipitate. When it is added to the blood of
 one of the distantly related &quot;half-monkeys&quot; or lemurs there is no
 reaction or only a very weak one. With the blood of mammals off the simian
 line altogether there is no reaction at all. Thus, as a distinguished
 anthropologist, Professor Schwalbe, has said: &quot;We have in this not only
 a proof of the literal blood-relationship between man and apes, but the
 degree of relationship with the different main groups of apes can be
 determined beyond possibility of mistake.&quot; We can imagine how this
 modern line of experiment would have delighted Darwin.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Embryological Proof of Man&#39;s Relationship with a Simian
 Stock</h4>

 <p>In his individual development, man does in some measure climb up his own
 genealogical tree. Stages in the development of the body during its nine
 months of ante-natal life are closely similar to stages in the development of
 the anthropoid embryo. Babies born in times of famine or siege are sometimes,
 as it were, imperfectly finished, and sometimes have what may be described as
 monkeyish features and ways. A visit to an institution for the care of
 children who show arrested, defective, or disturbed development leaves one
 sadly impressed with the risk of slipping down the rungs of the steep ladder
 of evolution; and even in adults the occurrence of serious nervous
 disturbance, such as &quot;shell-shock,&quot; is sometimes marked by relapses
 to animal ways. It is a familiar fact that a normal baby reveals the past in
 its surprising power of grip, and the careful experiments of Dr. Louis
 Robinson showed that an infant three weeks old could support its own weight
 for over two minutes, holding on to a horizontal bar. &quot;In many cases no
 sign of distress is evinced and no cry uttered, until the grasp begins to
 give way.&quot; This persistent grasp probably points back to the time when
 the baby had to cling to its arboreal mother. The human tail is represented
 in the adult by a fusion of four or five vertebræ forming the
 &quot;coccyx&quot; at the end of the backbone,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> and is normally concealed
 beneath the flesh, but in the embryo the tail projects freely and is movable.
 Up to the sixth month of the ante-natal sleep the body is covered, all but
 the palms and soles, with longish hair (the lanugo), which usually disappears
 before birth. This is a stage in the normal development, which is reasonably
 interpreted as a recapitulation of a stage in the racial evolution. We draw
 this inference when we find that the unborn offspring of an almost hairless
 whale has an abundant representation of hairs; we must draw a similar
 inference in the case of man.</p>

 <p>It must be noticed that there are two serious errors in the careless
 statement often made that man in his development is at one time like a little
 fish, at a later stage like a little reptile, at a later stage like a little
 primitive mammal, and eventually like a little monkey. The first error here
 is that the comparison should be made with <i>embryo</i>-fish,
 <i>embryo</i>-reptile, <i>embryo</i>-mammal, and so on. It is in the making
 of the embryos that the great resemblance lies. When the human embryo shows
 the laying down of the essential vertebrate characters, such as brain and
 spinal cord, then it is closely comparable to the embryo of a lower
 vertebrate at a similar stage. When, at a subsequent stage, its heart, for
 instance, is about to become a four-chambered mammalian heart, it is closely
 comparable to the heart of, let us say, a turtle, which never becomes more
 than three-chambered. The point is that in the making of the organs of the
 body, say brain and kidneys, the embryo of man pursues a path closely
 corresponding to the path followed by the embryos of other backboned animals
 lower in the scale, but at successive stages it parts company with these,
 with the lowest first and so on in succession. A human embryo is never like a
 little reptile, but the developing organs pass through stages which very
 closely resemble the corresponding stages in lower types which are in a
 general way ancestral.</p>

 <p>The second error is that every kind of animal, man included,<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> has from the
 first a certain individuality, with peculiar characteristics which are all
 its own. This is expressed by the somewhat difficult word <i>specificity</i>,
 which just means that every species is itself and no other. So in the
 development of the human embryo, while there are close resemblances to the
 embryos of apes, monkeys, other mammals, and even, at earlier stages still,
 to the embryos of reptile and fish, it has to be admitted that we are dealing
 from first to last with a human embryo with peculiarities of its own.</p>

 <p>Every human being begins his or her life as a single cell&mdash;a
 fertilised egg-cell, a treasure-house of all the ages. For in this living
 microcosm, only a small fraction (1/125) of an inch in diameter, there is
 condensed&mdash;who can imagine how?&mdash;all the natural inheritance of
 man, all the legacy of his parentage, of his ancestry, of his long pre-human
 pedigree. Darwin called the pinhead brain of the ant the most marvellous atom
 of matter in the world, but the human ovum is more marvellous still. It has
 more possibilities in it than any other thing, yet without fertilisation it
 will die. The fertilised ovum divides and redivides; there results a ball of
 cells and a sack of cells; gradually division of labour becomes the rule;
 there is a laying down of nervous system and food-canal, muscular system and
 skeleton, and so proceeds what is learnedly called differentiation. Out of
 the apparently simple there emerges the obviously complex. As Aristotle
 observed more than two thousand years ago, in the developing egg of the hen
 there soon appears the beating heart! There is nothing like this in the
 non-living world. But to return to the developing human embryo, there is
 formed from and above the embryonic food-canal a skeletal rod, which is
 called the notochord. It thrills the imagination to learn that this is the
 only supporting axis that the lower orders of the backboned race possess. The
 curious thing is that it does not become the backbone, which is certainly one
 of the essential features of the vertebrate race. The notochord is the
 supporting axis of the pioneer backboned animals,<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> namely the
 Lancelets and the Round-mouths (Cyclostomes), such as the Lamprey. They have
 no backbone in the strict sense, but they have this notochord. It can easily
 be dissected out in the lamprey&mdash;a long gristly rod. It is surrounded by
 a sheath which becomes the backbone of most fishes and of all higher animals.
 The interesting point is that although the notochord is only a vestige in the
 adults of these types, it is never absent from the embryo. It occurs even in
 man, a short-lived relic of the primeval supporting axis of the body. It
 comes and then it goes, leaving only minute traces in the adult. We cannot
 say that it is of any use, unless it serves as a stimulus to the development
 of its substitute, the backbone. It is only a piece of preliminary
 scaffolding, but there is no more eloquent instance of the living hand of the
 past.</p>

 <p>One other instance must suffice of what Professor Lull calls the wonderful
 changes wrought in the dark of the ante-natal period, which recapitulate in
 rapid abbreviation the great evolutionary steps which were taken by man&#39;s
 ancestors &quot;during the long night of the geological past.&quot; On the
 sides of the neck of the human embryo there are four pairs of slits, the
 &quot;visceral clefts,&quot; openings from the beginning of the food-canals
 to the surface. There is no doubt as to their significance. They correspond
 to the gill-slits of fishes and tadpoles. Yet in reptiles, birds, and mammals
 they have no connection with breathing, which is their function in fishes and
 amphibians. Indeed, they are not of any use at all, except that the first
 becomes the Eustachian tube bringing the ear-passage into connection with the
 back of the mouth, and that the second and third have to do with the
 development of a curious organ called the thymus gland. Persistent,
 nevertheless, these gill-slits are, recalling even in man an aquatic ancestry
 of many millions of years ago.</p>

 <p>When all these lines of evidence are considered, they are seen to converge
 in the conclusion that man is derived from a simian<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> stock of
 mammals. He is solidary with the rest of creation. To quote the closing words
 of Darwin&#39;s <i>Descent of Man</i>:</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man with all his
  noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with
  benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living
  creature, with his God-like intellect, which has penetrated into the
  movements and constitution of the solar system&mdash;with all these exalted
  powers&mdash;man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his
  lowly origin.</p>
 </div>

 <p>We should be clear that this view does not say more than that man sprang
 from a stock common to him and to the higher apes. Those who are repelled by
 the idea of man&#39;s derivation from a simian type should remember that the
 theory implies rather more than this, namely, that man is the outcome of a
 genealogy which has implied many millions of years of experimenting and
 sifting&mdash;the groaning and travailing of a whole creation. Speaking of
 man&#39;s mental qualities, Sir Ray Lankester says: &quot;They justify the
 view that man forms a new departure in the gradual unfolding of Nature&#39;s
 predestined plan.&quot; In any case, we have to try to square our views with
 the facts, not the facts with our views, and while one of the facts is that
 man stands unique and apart, the other is that man is a scion of a
 progressive simian stock. Naturalists have exposed the pit whence man has
 been digged and the rock whence he has been hewn, but it is surely a
 heartening encouragement to know that it is an ascent, not a descent, that we
 have behind us. There is wisdom in Pascal&#39;s maxim:</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>It is dangerous to show man too plainly how like he is to the animals,
  without, at the same time, reminding him of his greatness. It is equally
  unwise to impress him with his greatness and not with his lowliness. It is
  worse to leave him in ignorance of both. But it is very profitable to
  recognise the two facts.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 3</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Man&#39;s Pedigree</h4>

 <p>The facts of anatomy, physiology, and embryology, of which we have given
 illustrations, all point to man&#39;s affiliation with the order of monkeys
 and apes. To this order is given the name Primates, and our first and second
 question must be when and whence the Primates began. The rock record answers
 the first question: the Primates emerged about the dawn of the Eocene era,
 when grass was beginning to cover the earth with a garment. Their ancestral
 home was in the north in both hemispheres, and then they migrated to Africa,
 India, Malay, and South America. In North America the Primates soon became
 extinct, and the same thing happened later on in Europe. In this case,
 however, there was a repeopling from the South (in the Lower Miocene) and
 then a second extinction (in the Upper Pliocene) before man appeared. There
 is considerable evidence in support of Professor R. S. Lull&#39;s conclusion,
 that in Southern Asia, Africa, and South America the evolution of Primates
 was continuous since the first great southward migration, and there is, of
 course, an abundant modern representation of Primates in these regions
 to-day.</p>

 <p>As to the second question: Whence the Primates sprang, the answer must be
 more conjectural. But it is a reasonable view that Carnivores and Primates
 sprang from a common Insectivore stock, the one order diverging towards
 flesh-eating and hunting on the ground, the other order diverging towards
 fruit-eating and arboreal habits. There is no doubt that the Insectivores
 (including shrews, tree-shrews, hedgehog, mole, and the like) were very
 plastic and progressive mammals.</p>

 <p>What followed in the course of ages was the divergence of branch after
 branch from the main Primate stem. First there diverged the South American
 monkeys on a line of their own, and then the Old World monkeys, such as the
 macaques and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg
 165]</a></span> baboons. Ages passed and the main stems gave off (in the
 Oligocene period) the branch now represented by the small anthropoid
 apes&mdash;the gibbon and the siamang. Distinctly later there diverged the
 branch of the large anthropoid apes&mdash;the gorilla, the chimpanzee, and
 the orang. That left a generalised humanoid stock separated off from all
 monkeys and apes, and including the immediate precursors of man. When this
 sifting out of a generalised humanoid stock took place remains very
 uncertain, some authorities referring it to the Miocene, others to the early
 Pliocene. Some would estimate its date at half a million years ago, others at
 two millions! The fact is that questions of chronology do not as yet admit of
 scientific statement.</p>

 <p>We are on firmer, though still uncertain, ground when we state the
 probability that it was in Asia that the precursors of man were separated off
 from monkeys and apes, and began to be terrestrial rather than arboreal.
 Professor Lull points out that Asia is nearest to the oldest known human
 remains (in Java), and that Asia was the seat of the most ancient
 civilisations and the original home of many domesticated animals and
 cultivated plants. The probability is that the cradle of the human race was
 in Asia.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Man&#39;s Arboreal Apprenticeship</h4>

 <p>At this point it will be useful to consider man&#39;s arboreal
 apprenticeship and how he became a terrestrial journeyman. Professor Wood
 Jones has worked out very convincingly the thesis that man had no direct
 four-footed ancestry, but that the Primate stock to which he belongs was from
 its first divergence arboreal. He maintains that the leading peculiarities of
 the immediate precursors of man were wrought out during a long arboreal
 apprenticeship. The first great gain of arboreal life on bipedal erect lines
 (not after the quadrupedal fashion of tree-sloths, for instance) was the
 emancipation of the hand. The foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166"
 id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> became the supporting and branch-gripping
 member, and the hand was set free to reach upward, to hang on by, to seize
 the fruit, to lift it and hold it to the mouth, and to hug the young one
 close to the breast. The hand thus set free has remained plastic&mdash;a
 generalised, not a specialised member. Much has followed from man&#39;s
 &quot;handiness.&quot;</p>

 <p>The arboreal life had many other consequences. It led to an increased
 freedom of movement of the thigh on the hip joint, to muscular arrangements
 for balancing the body on the leg, to making the backbone a supple yet stable
 curved pillar, to a strongly developed collar-bone which is only found
 well-formed when the fore-limb is used for more than support, and to a power
 of &quot;opposing&quot; the thumb and the big toe to the other digits of the
 hand and foot&mdash;an obvious advantage for branch-gripping. But the
 evolution of a free hand made it possible to dispense with protrusive lips
 and gripping teeth. Thus began the recession of the snout region, the
 associated enlargement of the brain-box, and the bringing of the eyes to the
 front. The overcrowding of the teeth that followed the shortening of the
 snout was one of the taxes on progress of which modern man is often reminded
 in his dental troubles.</p>

 <p>Another acquisition associated with arboreal life was a greatly increased
 power of turning the head from side to side&mdash;a mobility very important
 in locating sounds and in exploring with the eyes. Furthermore, there came
 about a flattening of the chest and of the back, and the movements of the
 midriff (or diaphragm) came to count for more in respiration than the
 movements of the ribs. The sense of touch came to be of more importance and
 the sense of smell of less; the part of the brain receiving tidings from hand
 and eye and ear came to predominate over the part for receiving olfactory
 messages. Finally, the need for carrying the infant about among the branches
 must surely have implied an intensification of family relations, and favoured
 the evolution of gentleness.</p>

  </div>
 </div>

 <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg

 <p>It may be urged that we are attaching too much importance to the arboreal
 apprenticeship, since many tree-loving animals remain to-day very innocent
 creatures. To this reasonable objection there are two answers, first that in
 its many acquisitions the arboreal evolution of the <i>humanoid</i>
 precursors of man prepared the way for the survival of a <i>human</i> type
 marked by a great step in brain-development; and second that the passage from
 the humanoid to the human was probably associated with <i>a return to mother
 earth</i>.</p>

 <p>According to Professor Lull, to whose fine textbook, <i>Organic
 Evolution</i> (1917), we are much indebted, &quot;climatic conditions in Asia
 in the Miocene or early Pliocene were such as to compel the descent of the
 pre-human ancestor from the trees, a step which was absolutely essential to
 further human development.&quot; Continental elevation and consequent aridity
 led to a dwindling of the forests, and forced the ape-man to come to earth.
 &quot;And at the last arose the man.&quot;</p>

 <p>According to Lull, the descent from the trees was associated with the
 assumption of a more erect posture, with increased liberation and plasticity
 of the hand, with becoming a hunter, with experiments towards clothing and
 shelter, with an exploring habit, and with the beginning of communal
 life.</p>

 <p>It is a plausible view that the transition from the humanoid to the human
 was effected by a discontinuous variation of considerable magnitude, what is
 nowadays called a <i>mutation</i>, and that it had mainly to do with the
 brain and the vocal organs. But given the gains of the arboreal
 apprenticeship, the stimulus of an enforced descent to terra firma, and an
 evolving brain and voice, we can recognise accessory factors which helped
 success to succeed. Perhaps the absence of great physical strength prompted
 reliance on wits; the prolongation of infancy would help to educate the
 parents in gentleness; the strengthening of the feeling of kinship would
 favour the evolution of family and social life&mdash;of which there are many
 anticipations at lower levels. There is<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> much truth in the saying:
 &quot;Man did not make society, society made man.&quot;</p>

 <p>A continuation of the story will deal with the emergence of the primitive
 types of man and the gradual ascent of the modern species.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 4</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Tentative Men</h4>

 <p>So far the story has been that of the sifting out of a humanoid stock and
 of the transition to human kind, from the ancestors of apes and men to the
 man-ape, and from the man-ape to man. It looks as if the sifting-out process
 had proceeded further, for there were several human branches that did not
 lead on to the modern type of man.</p>

 <p>1. The first of these is represented by the scanty fossil remains known as
 <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>, found in Java in fossiliferous beds which
 date from the end of the Pliocene or the beginning of the Pleistocene era.
 Perhaps this means half a million years ago, and the remains occurred along
 with those of some mammals which are now extinct. Unfortunately the remains
 of Pithecanthropus the Erect consisted only of a skull-cap, a thigh-bone, and
 two back teeth, so it is not surprising that experts should differ
 considerably in their interpretation of what was found. Some have regarded
 the remains as those of a large gibbon, others as those of a pre-human
 ape-man, and others as those of a primitive man off the main line of ascent.
 According to Sir Arthur Keith, Pithecanthropus was &quot;a being human in
 stature, human in gait, human in all its parts, save its brain.&quot; The
 thigh-bone indicates a height of about 5 feet 7 inches, one inch less than
 the average height of the men of to-day. The skull-cap indicates a low, flat
 forehead, beetling brows, and a capacity about two-thirds of the modern size.
 The remains were found by Dubois, in 1894, in Trinil in Central Java.</p>

 <p>2. The next offshoot is represented by the Heidelberg man<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> (<i>Homo
 heidelbergensis</i>), discovered near Heidelberg in 1907 by Dr. Schoetensack.
 But the remains consisted only of a lower jaw and its teeth. Along with this
 relic were bones of various mammals, including some long since extinct in
 Europe, such as elephant, rhinoceros, bison, and lion. The circumstances
 indicate an age of perhaps 300,000 years ago. There were also very crude
 flint implements (or eoliths). But the teeth are human teeth, and the jaw
 seems transitional between that of an anthropoid ape and that of man. Thus
 there was no chin. According to most authorities the lower jaw from the
 Heidelberg sand-pit must be regarded as a relic of a primitive type off the
 main line of human ascent.</p>

 <p>3. It was in all probability in the Pliocene that there took origin the
 Neanderthal species of man, <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i>, first known from
 remains found in 1856 in the Neanderthal ravine near Düsseldorf. According to
 some authorities Neanderthal man was living in Europe a quarter of a million
 years ago. Other specimens were afterwards found elsewhere, e.g. in Belgium
 (&quot;the men of Spy&quot;), in France, in Croatia, and at Gibraltar, so
 that a good deal is known of Neanderthal man. He was a loose-limbed fellow,
 short of stature and of slouching gait, but a skilful artificer, fashioning
 beautifully worked flints with a characteristic style. He used fire; he
 buried his dead reverently and furnished them with an outfit for a long
 journey; and he had a big brain. But he had great beetling, ape-like eyebrow
 ridges and massive jaws, and he showed &quot;simian characters swarming in
 the details of his structure.&quot; In most of the points in which he differs
 from modern man he approaches the anthropoid apes, and he must be regarded as
 a low type of man off the main line. Huxley regarded the Neanderthal man as a
 low form of the modern type, but expert opinion seems to agree rather with
 the view maintained in 1864 by Professor William King of Galway, that the
 Neanderthal man represents a distinct species off the main line of ascent. He
 disappeared with apparent suddenness (like some aboriginal races to-day)
 about the end of the Fourth Great Ice Age; but<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> there is evidence that before he
 ceased to be there had emerged a successor rather than a descendant&mdash;the
 modern man.</p>

 <p>4. Another offshoot from the main line is probably represented by the
 Piltdown man, found in Sussex in 1912. The remains consisted of the walls of
 the skull, which indicate a large brain, and a high forehead without the
 beetling eyebrows of the Neanderthal man and Pithecanthropus. The
 &quot;find&quot; included a tooth and part of a lower jaw, but these perhaps
 belong to some ape, for they are very discrepant. The Piltdown skull
 represents the most ancient human remains as yet found in Britain, and Dr.
 Smith Woodward&#39;s establishment of a separate genus Eoanthropus expresses
 his conviction that the Piltdown man was off the line of the evolution of the
 modern type. If the tooth and piece of lower jaw belong to the Piltdown
 skull, then there was a remarkable combination of ape-like and human
 characters. As regards the brain, <i>inferred</i> from the skull-walls, Sir
 Arthur Keith says:</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>All the essential features of the brain of modern man are to be seen in
  the brain cast. There are some which must be regarded as primitive. There
  can be no doubt that it is built on exactly the same lines as our modern
  brains. A few minor alterations would make it in all respects a modern
  brain.... Although our knowledge of the human brain is limited&mdash;there
  are large areas to which we can assign no definite function&mdash;we may
  rest assured that a brain which was shaped in a mould so similar to our own
  was one which responded to the outside world as ours does. Piltdown man saw,
  heard, felt, thought, and dreamt much as we do still.</p>
 </div>

 <p>And this was 150,000 years ago at a modern estimate, and some would say
 half a million.</p>

 <p>There is neither agreement nor certainty as to the antiquity of man,
 except that the modern type was distinguishable from its collaterals hundreds
 of thousands of years ago. The general impression left is very grand. In
 remote antiquity the Primate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id=
 "Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> stem diverged from the other orders of
 mammals; it sent forth its tentative branches, and the result was a tangle of
 monkeys; ages passed and the monkeys were left behind, while the main stem,
 still probing its way, gave off the Anthropoid apes, both small and large.
 But they too were left behind, and the main line gave off other
 experiments&mdash;indications of which we know in Java, at Heidelberg, in the
 Neanderthal, and at Piltdown. None of these lasted or was made perfect. They
 represent <i>tentative</i> men who had their day and ceased to be, our
 predecessors rather than our ancestors. Still, the main stem goes on
 evolving, and who will be bold enough to say what fruit it has yet to
 bear!</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Primitive Men</h4>

 <p>Ancient skeletons of men of the modern type have been found in many
 places, e.g. Combe Capelle in Dordogne, Galley Hill in Kent, Cro-Magnon in
 Périgord, Mentone on the Riviera; and they are often referred to as
 &quot;Cave-men&quot; or &quot;men of the Early Stone Age.&quot; They had
 large skulls, high foreheads, well-marked chins, and other features such as
 modern man possesses. They were true men at last&mdash;that is to say, like
 ourselves! The spirited pictures they made on the walls of caves in France
 and Spain show artistic sense and skill. Well-finished statuettes
 representing nude female figures are also known. The elaborate burial customs
 point to a belief in life after death. They made stone
 implements&mdash;knives, scrapers, gravers, and the like, of the type known
 as Palæolithic, and these show interesting gradations of skill and
 peculiarities of style. The &quot;Cave-men&quot; lived between the third and
 fourth Ice Ages, along with cave-bear, cave-lion, cave-hyæna, mammoth, woolly
 rhinoceros, Irish elk, and other mammals now extinct&mdash;taking us back to
 30,000-50,000 years ago, and many would say much more. Some of the
 big-brained skulls of these Palæolithic cave-men show not a single feature
 that could be called primitive. They show teeth which in size and form are
 exactly the same as those of a thousand generations<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
 afterwards&mdash;and suffering from gumboil too! There seems little doubt
 that these vigorous Palæolithic Cave-men of Europe were living for a while
 contemporaneously with the men of Neanderthal, and it is possible that they
 directly or indirectly hastened the disappearance of their more primitive
 collaterals. Curiously enough, however, they had not themselves adequate
 lasting power in Europe, for they seem for the most part to have dwindled
 away, leaving perhaps stray present-day survivors in isolated districts. The
 probability is that after their decline Europe was repeopled by immigrants
 from Asia. It cannot be said that there is any inherent biological necessity
 for the decline of a vigorous race&mdash;many animal races go back for
 millions of years&mdash;but in mankind the historical fact is that a period
 of great racial vigour and success is often followed by a period of decline,
 sometimes leading to practical disappearance as a definite race. The causes
 of this waning remain very obscure&mdash;sometimes environmental, sometimes
 constitutional, sometimes competitive. Sometimes the introduction of a new
 parasite, like the malaria organism, may have been to blame.</p>

 <p>After the Ice Ages had passed, perhaps 25,000 years ago, the Palæolithic
 culture gave place to the Neolithic. The men who made rudely dressed but
 often beautiful stone implements were succeeded or replaced by men who made
 polished stone implements. The earliest inhabitants of Scotland were of this
 Neolithic culture, migrating from the Continent when the ice-fields of the
 Great Glaciation had disappeared. Their remains are often associated with the
 &quot;Fifty-foot Beach&quot; which, though now high and dry, was the seashore
 in early Neolithic days. Much is known about these men of the polished
 stones. They were hunters, fowlers, and fishermen; without domesticated
 animals or agriculture; short folk, two or three inches below the present
 standard; living an active strenuous life. Similarly, for the south, Sir
 Arthur Keith pictures for us a Neolithic community at Coldrum in Kent, dating
 from about 4,000 years ago&mdash;a few ticks of the<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> geological
 clock. It consisted, in this case, of agricultural pioneers, men with large
 heads and big brains, about two inches shorter in stature than the modern
 British average (5 ft. 8 in.), with better teeth and broader palates than men
 have in these days of soft food, with beliefs concerning life and death
 similar to those that swayed their contemporaries in Western and Southern
 Europe. Very interesting is the manipulative skill they showed on a large
 scale in erecting standing stones (probably connected with calendar-keeping
 and with worship), and on a small scale in making daring operations on the
 skull. Four thousand years ago is given as a probable date for that early
 community in Kent, but evidences of Neolithic man occur in situations which
 demand a much greater antiquity&mdash;perhaps 30,000 years. And man was not
 young then!</p>

 </div>

 <p>We must open one more chapter in the thrilling story of the Ascent of
 Man&mdash;the Metal Ages, which are in a sense still continuing. Metals began
 to be used in the late Polished Stone (Neolithic) times, for there were
 always overlappings. Copper came first, Bronze second, and Iron last. The
 working of copper in the East has been traced back to the fourth millennium
 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and there was also a very ancient Copper Age
 in the New World. It need hardly be said that where copper is scarce, as in
 Britain, we cannot expect to find much trace of a Copper Age.</p>

 <p>The ores of different metals seem to have been smelted together in an
 experimental way by many prehistoric metallurgists, and bronze was the alloy
 that rewarded the combination of tin with copper. There is evidence of a more
 or less definite Bronze Age in Egypt and Babylonia, Greece and Europe.</p>

 <p>It is not clear why iron should not have been the earliest metal to be
 used by man, but the Iron Age dates from about the middle of the second
 millennium <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> From Egypt the usage spread
 through the Mediterranean region to North Europe, or it may have been that
 discoveries made in Central Europe, so rich in iron-mines, saturated
 southwards, following for instance, the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> route of the amber trade from
 the Baltic. Compared with stone, the metals afforded much greater
 possibilities of implements, instruments, and weapons, and their discovery
 and usage had undoubtedly great influence on the Ascent of Man. Occasionally,
 however, on his descent.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Retrospect</h4>

 <p>Looking backwards, we discern the following stages: (1) The setting apart
 of a Primate stock, marked off from other mammals by a tendency to big
 brains, a free hand, gregariousness, and good-humoured talkativeness. (2) The
 divergence of marmosets and New World monkeys and Old World monkeys, leaving
 a stock&mdash;an anthropoid stock&mdash;common to the present-day and extinct
 apes and to mankind. (3) From this common stock the Anthropoid apes diverged,
 far from ignoble creatures, and a humanoid stock was set apart. (4) From the
 latter (we follow Sir Arthur Keith and other authorities) there arose what
 may be called, without disparagement, tentative or experimental men,
 indicated by Pithecanthropus &quot;the Erect,&quot; the Heidelberg man, the
 Neanderthalers, and, best of all, the early men of the Sussex
 Weald&mdash;hinted at by the Piltdown skull. It matters little whether
 particular items are corroborated or disproved&mdash;e.g. whether the
 Heidelberg man came before or after the Neanderthalers&mdash;the general
 trend of evolution remains clear. (5) In any case, the result was the
 evolution of <i>Homo sapiens, the man we are</i>&mdash;a quite different
 fellow from the Neanderthaler. (6) Then arose various stocks of primitive
 men, proving everything and holding fast to that which is good. There were
 the Palæolithic peoples, with rude stone implements, a strong vigorous race,
 but probably, in most cases, supplanted by fresh experiments. These may have
 arisen as shoots from the growing point of the old race, or as a fresh
 offshoot from more generalised members at a lower level. This is the eternal
 possible victory alike of aristocracy and democracy. (7) Palæolithic men were
 involved in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg
 175]</a></span> succession of four Great Ice Ages or Glaciations, and it may
 be that the human race owes much to the alternation of hard times and easy
 times&mdash;glacial and interglacial. When the ice-fields cleared off
 Neolithic man had his innings. (8) And we have closed the story, in the
 meantime, with the Metal Ages.</p>

   <p>THE NEANDERTHAL MAN OF LA CHAPELLE-AUX-SAINTS</p>

   <p class="wide">The men of this race lived in Europe from the Third
   Interglacial period through the Fourth Glacial. They disappeared somewhat
   suddenly, being replaced by the Modern Man type, such as the Cromagnards.
   Many regard the Neanderthal Men as a distinct species.</p>
  </div>
 </div>

 <p>It seems not unfitting that we should at this point sound another
 note&mdash;that of the man of feeling. It is clear in William James&#39;s
 words:</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>Bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, are these half-brutish
  prehistoric brothers. Girdled about with the immense darkness of this
  mysterious universe even as we are, they were born and died, suffered and
  struggled. Given over to fearful crime and passion, plunged in the blackest
  ignorance, preyed upon by hideous and grotesque delusions, yet steadfastly
  serving the profoundest of ideals in their fixed faith that existence in any
  form is better than non-existence, they ever rescued triumphantly from the
  jaws of ever imminent destruction the torch of life which, thanks to them,
  now lights the world for us.</p>
 </div>

 <h4 class="sect">Races of Mankind</h4>

 <p>Given a variable stock spreading over diverse territory, we expect to find
 it splitting up into varieties which may become steadied into races or
 incipient species. Thus we have races of hive-bees, &quot;Italians,&quot;
 &quot;Punics,&quot; and so forth; and thus there arose races of men. Certain
 types suited certain areas, and periods of in-breeding tended to make the
 distinctive peculiarities of each incipient race well-defined and stable.
 When the original peculiarities, say, of negro and Mongol, Australian and
 Caucasian, arose as brusque variations or &quot;mutations,&quot; then they
 would have great staying power from generation to generation. They would not
 be readily swamped by intercrossing or averaged off. Peculiarities and
 changes of climate and surroundings, not to speak of other change-producing
 factors, would provoke new departures from age to age, and so fresh racial
 ventures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg
 176]</a></span> were made. Moreover, the occurrence of out-breeding when two
 races met, in peace or in war, would certainly serve to induce fresh starts.
 Very important in the evolution of human races must have been the alternating
 occurrence of periods of in-breeding (endogamy), tending to stability and
 sameness, and periods of out-breeding (exogamy), tending to changefulness and
 diversity.</p>

 <p>Thus we may distinguish several more or less clearly defined primitive
 races of mankind&mdash;notably the African, the Australian, the Mongolian,
 and the Caucasian. The woolly-haired African race includes the negroes and
 the very primitive bushmen. The wavy-to curly-haired Australian race includes
 the Jungle Tribes of the Deccan, the Vedda of Ceylon, the Jungle Folk or
 Semang, and the natives of unsettled parts of Australia&mdash;all sometimes
 slumped together as &quot;Pre-Dravidians.&quot; The straight-haired Mongols
 include those of Tibet, Indo-China, China, and Formosa, those of many oceanic
 islands, and of the north from Japan to Lapland. The Caucasians include
 Mediterraneans, Semites, Nordics, Afghans, Alpines, and many more.</p>

 <p>There are very few corners of knowledge more difficult than that of the
 Races of Men, the chief reason being that there has been so much movement and
 migration in the course of the ages. One physical type has mingled with
 another, inducing strange amalgams and novelties. If we start with what might
 be called &quot;zoological&quot; races or strains differing, for instance, in
 their hair (woolly-haired Africans, straight-haired Mongols, curly-or
 wavy-haired Pre-Dravidians and Caucasians), we find these replaced by
 <i>peoples</i> who are mixtures of various races, &quot;brethren by
 civilisation more than by blood.&quot; As Professor Flinders Petrie has said,
 the only meaning the term &quot;race&quot; now can have is that of a group of
 human beings whose type has been unified by their rate of assimilation
 exceeding the rate of change produced by the infiltration of foreign
 elements. It is probable, however, that the progress of precise anthropology
 will make it possible to distinguish the various racial &quot;strains&quot;
 that make up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg
 177]</a></span> any people. For the human sense of race is so strong that it
 convinces us of reality even when scientific definition is impossible. It was
 this the British sailor expressed in his answer to the question &quot;What is
 a Dago?&quot; &quot;Dagoes,&quot; he replied, &quot;is anything wot isn&#39;t
 our sort of chaps.&quot;</p>

 </div>

 <h4 class="sect">Steps in Human Evolution</h4>

 <p>Real men arose, we believe, by variational uplifts of considerable
 magnitude which led to big and complex brains and to the power of reasoned
 discourse. In some other lines of mammalian evolution there were from time to
 time great advances in the size and complexity of the brain, as is clear, for
 instance, in the case of horses and elephants. The same is true of birds as
 compared with reptiles, and everyone recognises the high level of excellence
 that has been attained by their vocal powers. How these great cerebral
 advances came about we do not know, but it has been one of the main trends of
 animal evolution to improve the nervous system. Two suggestions may be made.
 First, the prolongation of the period of ante-natal life, in intimate
 physiological partnership with the mother, may have made it practicable to
 start the higher mammal with a much better brain than in the lower orders,
 like Insectivores and Rodents, and still more Marsupials, where the period
 before birth (gestation) is short. Second, we know that the individual
 development of the brain is profoundly influenced by the internal secretions
 of certain ductless glands notably the thyroid. When this organ is not
 functioning properly the child&#39;s brain development is arrested. It may be
 that increased production of certain hormones&mdash;itself, of course, to be
 accounted for&mdash;may have stimulated brain development in man&#39;s remote
 ancestors.</p>

 <p>Given variability along the line of better brains and given a process of
 discriminate sifting which would consistently offer rewards to alertness and
 foresight, to kin-sympathy and parental care, there seems no great difficulty
 in imagining how Man would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id=
 "Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> evolve. We must not think of an Aristotle or a
 Newton except as fine results which justify all the groaning and travailing;
 we must think of average men, of primitive peoples to-day, and of our
 forbears long ago. We must remember how much of man&#39;s advance is
 dependent on the external registration of the social heritage, not on the
 slowly changing natural inheritance.</p>

 <p>Looking backwards it is impossible, we think, to fail to recognise
 progress. There is a ring of truth in the fine description Æschylus gave of
 primitive men that&mdash;</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>first, beholding they beheld in vain, and, hearing, heard not, but, like
  shapes in dreams, mixed all things wildly down the tedious time, nor knew to
  build a house against the sun with wicketed sides, nor any woodwork knew,
  but lived like silly ants, beneath the ground, in hollow caves unsunned.
  There came to them no steadfast sign of winter, nor of spring
  flower-perfumed, nor of summer full of fruit, but blindly and lawlessly they
  did all things.</p>
 </div>

 <p>Contrast this picture with the position of man to-day. He has mastered the
 forces of Nature and is learning to use their resources more and more
 economically; he has harnessed electricity to his chariot and he has made the
 ether carry his messages. He tapped supplies of material which seemed for
 centuries unavailable, having learned, for instance, how to capture and
 utilise the free nitrogen of the air. With his telegraph and
 &quot;wireless&quot; he has annihilated distance, and he has added to his
 navigable kingdom the depths of the sea and the heights of the air. He has
 conquered one disease after another, and the young science of heredity is
 showing him how to control in his domesticated animals and cultivated plants
 the nature of the generations yet unborn. With all his faults he has his
 ethical face set in the right direction. The main line of movement is towards
 the fuller embodiment of the true, the beautiful, and the good in healthy
 lives which are increasingly a satisfaction in themselves.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Factors in Human Progress</h4>

 <p>Many, we believe, were the gains that rewarded the arboreal apprenticeship
 of man&#39;s ancestors. Many, likewise, were the results of leaving the trees
 and coming down to the solid earth&mdash;a transition which marked the
 emergence of more than tentative men. What great steps followed?</p>

 <p>Some of the greatest were&mdash;the working out of a spoken language and
 of external methods of registration; the invention of tools; the discovery of
 the use of fire; the utilisation of iron and other metals; the taming of wild
 animals such as dog and sheep, horses and cattle; the cultivation of wild
 plants such as wheat and rice; and the irrigation of fields. All through the
 ages necessity has been the mother of invention and curiosity its father; but
 perhaps we miss the heart of the matter if we forget the importance of some
 leisure time&mdash;wherein to observe and think. If our earth had been so
 clouded that the stars were hidden from men&#39;s eyes the whole history of
 our race would have been different. For it was through his leisure-time
 observations of the stars that early man discovered the regularity of the
 year and got his fundamental impressions of the order of Nature&mdash;on
 which all his science is founded.</p>

 <p>If we are to think clearly of the factors of human progress we must recall
 the three great biological ideas&mdash;the living organism, its environment,
 and its functioning. For man these mean (1) the living creature, the outcome
 of parents and ancestors, a fresh expression of a bodily and mental
 inheritance; (2) the surroundings, including climate and soil, the plants and
 animals these allow; and (3) the activities of all sorts, occupations and
 habits, all the actions and reactions between man and his milieu. In short,
 we have to deal with <span class="smcap">Folk, Place, Work</span>; the
 <i>Famille</i>, <i>Lieu</i>, <i>Travail</i> of the LePlay school.</p>

 <p>As to <span class="smcap">Folk</span>, human progress depends on intrinsic
 racial qualities&mdash;notably health and vigour of body, clearness and
 alertness of mind, and an indispensable sociality. The most
 powerful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg
 180]</a></span> factors in the world are clear ideas in the minds of
 energetic men of good will. The differences in bodily and mental health which
 mark races, and stocks within a people, just as they mark individuals, are
 themselves traceable back to germinal variations or mutations, and to the
 kind of sifting to which the race or stock has been subjected. Easygoing
 conditions are not only without stimulus to new departures, they are without
 the sifting which progress demands.</p>

 <p>As to <span class="smcap">Place</span>, it is plain that different areas
 differ greatly in their material resources and in the availability of these.
 Moreover, even when abundant material resources are present, they will not
 make for much progress unless the climate is such that they can be readily
 utilised. Indeed, climate has been one of the great factors in civilisation,
 here stimulating and there depressing energy, in one place favouring certain
 plants and animals important to man, in another place preventing their
 presence. Moreover, climate has slowly changed from age to age.</p>

 <p>As to <span class="smcap">Work</span>, the form of a civilisation is in
 some measure dependent on the primary occupations, whether hunting or
 fishing, farming or shepherding; and on the industries of later ages which
 have a profound moulding effect on the individual at least. We cannot,
 however, say more than that the factors of human progress have always had
 these three aspects, Folk, Place, Work, and that if progress is to continue
 on stable lines it must always recognise the essential correlation of fitter
 folk in body and mind: improved habits and functions, alike in work and
 leisure; and bettered surroundings in the widest and deepest sense.</p>

 <h2>EVOLUTION GOING ON</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>EVOLUTION GOING ON</h3>

 <p>Evolution, as we have seen in a previous chapter, is another word for
 race-history. It means the ceaseless process of Becoming, linking generation
 to generation of living creatures. The Doctrine of Evolution states the fact
 that the present is the child of the past and the parent of the future. It
 comes to this, that the living plants and animals we know are descended from
 ancestors on the whole simpler, and these from others likewise simpler, and
 so on, back and back&mdash;till we reach the first living creatures, of
 which, unfortunately, we know nothing. Evolution is a process of racial
 change in a definite direction, whereby new forms arise, take root, and
 flourish, alongside of or in the place of their ancestors, which were in most
 cases rather simpler in structure and behaviour.</p>

 <p>The rock-record, which cannot be wrong, though we may read it wrongly,
 shows clearly that there was once a time in the history of the Earth when the
 only backboned animals were Fishes. Ages passed, and there evolved
 Amphibians, with fingers and toes, scrambling on to dry land. Ages passed,
 and there evolved Reptiles, in bewildering profusion. There were fish-lizards
 and sea-serpents, terrestrial dragons and flying dragons, a prolific and
 varied stock. From the terrestrial Dinosaurs it seems that Birds and Mammals
 arose. In succeeding ages there evolved all the variety of Birds and all the
 variety of Mammals. Until at last arose the Man. The question is whether
 similar processes of evolution are still going on.</p>

 <p>We are so keenly aware of rapid changes in mankind, though<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> these concern
 the social heritage much more than the flesh-and-blood natural inheritance,
 that we find no difficulty in the idea that evolution is going on in mankind.
 We know the contrast between modern man and primitive man, and we are
 convinced that in the past, at least, progress has been a reality. That
 degeneration may set in is an awful possibility&mdash;involution rather than
 evolution&mdash;but even if going back became for a time the rule, we cannot
 give up the hope that the race would recover itself and begin afresh to go
 forward. For although there have been retrogressions in the history of life,
 continued through unthinkably long ages, and although great races, the Flying
 Dragons for instance, have become utterly extinct, leaving no successors
 whatsoever, we feel sure that there has been on the whole a progress towards
 nobler, more masterful, more emancipated, more intelligent, and <i>better</i>
 forms of life&mdash;a progress towards what mankind at its best has always
 regarded as best, i.e. affording most enduring satisfaction. So we think of
 evolution going on in mankind, evolution chequered by involution, but on the
 whole <i>progressive evolution</i>.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Evolutionary Prospect for Man</h4>

 <p>It is not likely that man&#39;s body will admit of <i>great</i> change,
 but there is room for some improvement, e.g. in the superfluous length of the
 food-canal and the overcrowding of the teeth. It is likely, however, that
 there will be constitutional changes, e.g. of prolonged youthfulness, a
 higher standard of healthfulness, and a greater resistance to disease. It is
 justifiable to look forward to great improvements in intelligence and in
 control. The potentialities of the human brain, as it is, are far from being
 utilised to the full, and new departures of promise are of continual
 occurrence. What is of great importance is that the new departures or
 variations which emerge in fine children should be fostered, not nipped in
 the bud, by the social environment, education included. The evolutionary
 prospect for man is promising.</p>

   long. The animal lives in the last chamber only, but a tube (S) runs
   through the empty chambers, perforating the partitions (SE). The bulk of
   the animal is marked VM; the eye is shown at E; a hood is marked H; round
   the mouth there are numerous lobes (L) bearing protrusible tentacles, some

   tentacles radiate out in all directions, and it has been described as
   &quot;a shell with something like a cauliflower sticking out of it.&quot;
   The Pearly Nautilus is a good example of a conservative type, for it began
   in the Triassic Era. But the family of Nautiloids to which it belongs
   illustrates very vividly what is meant by a dwindling race. The Nautiloids
   began in the Cambrian, reached their golden age in the Silurian, and began
   to decline markedly in the Carboniferous. There are 2,500 extinct or fossil
   species of Nautiloids, and only 4 living to-day.</p>

 <p>But it is very important to realise that among plant and animals likewise,
 <i>Evolution is going on</i>.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Fountain of Change: Variability</h4>

 <p>On an ordinary big clock we do not readily see that even the minute hand
 is moving, and if the clock struck only once in a hundred years we can
 conceive of people arguing whether the hands did really move at all. So it
 often is with the changes that go on from generation to generation in living
 creatures. The flux is so slow, like the flowing of a glacier, that some
 people fail to be convinced of its reality. And it must, of course, be
 admitted that some kinds of living creatures, like the Lamp-shell
 <i>Ligula</i> or the Pearly Nautilus, hardly change from age to age, whereas
 others, like some of the birds and butterflies, are always giving rise to
 something new. The Evening Primrose among plants, and the Fruit-fly,
 Drosophila, among animals, are well-known examples of organisms which are at
 present in a sporting or mutating mood.</p>

 <p>Certain dark varieties of moth, e.g. of the Peppered Moth, are taking the
 place of the paler type in some parts of England, and the same is true of
 some dark forms of Sugar-bird in the West Indian islands. Very important is
 the piece of statistics worked out by Professor R. C. Punnett, that &quot;if
 a population contains .001 per cent of a new variety, and if that variety has
 even a 5 per cent selection advantage over the original form, the latter will
 almost completely disappear in less than a hundred generations.&quot; This
 sort of thing has been going on all over the world for untold ages, and the
 face of animate nature has consequently changed.</p>

 <p>We are impressed by striking novelties that crop up&mdash;a clever dwarf,
 a musical genius, a calculating boy, a cock with a 10 ft. tail, a
 &quot;wonder-horse&quot; with a mane reaching to the ground, a tailless cat,
 a white blackbird, a copper beech, a Greater Celandine with much cut up
 leaves; but this sort of mutation is common, and smaller, less brusque
 variations are commoner still. <i>They form the raw materials of possible
 evolution.</i> We are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id=
 "Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> actually standing before an apparently
 inexhaustible fountain of change. This is evolution going on.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Sporting Jellyfish</h4>

 <p>It is of interest to consider a common animal like the jellyfish Aurelia.
 It is admirably suited for a leisurely life in the open sea, where it swims
 about by contracting its saucer-shaped body, thus driving water out from its
 concavity. By means of millions of stinging cells on its four frilled lips
 and on its marginal tentacles it is able to paralyse and lasso minute
 crustaceans and the like, which it then wafts into its mouth. It has a very
 eventful life-history, for it has in its early youth to pass through a fixed
 stage, fastened to rock or seaweed, but it is a successful animal, well
 suited for its habitat, and practically cosmopolitan in its distribution. It
 is certainly an old-established creature. Yet it is very variable in colour
 and in size, and even in internal structure. Very often it is the size of a
 saucer or a soup-plate, but giants over two feet in diameter are well known.
 Much more important, however, than variation in colour and size are the
 inborn changes in structure. Normally a jellyfish has its parts in four or
 multiples of four. Thus it has four frilled lips, four tufts of digestive
 filaments in its stomach, and four brightly coloured reproductive organs. It
 has eight sense-organs round the margin of its disc, eight branched and eight
 unbranched radial canals running from the central stomach to a canal round
 the circumference. The point of giving these details is just this, that every
 now and then we find a jellyfish with its parts in sixes, fives, or threes,
 and with a multitude of minor idiosyncrasies. <i>Even in the well-established
 jellyfish there is a fountain of change.</i></p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Evolution of Plants</h4>

 <p>It is instructive to look at the various kinds of cabbages, such as
 cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, kale and curly greens, and<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> remember that
 they are all scions of the not very promising wild cabbage found on our
 shores. And are not all the aristocrat apple-trees of our orchards descended
 from the plebeian crab-apple of the roadside? We know far too little about
 the precise origin of our cultivated plants, but there is no doubt that after
 man got a hold of them he took advantage of their variability to establish
 race after race, say, of rose and chrysanthemum, of potato and cereal. The
 evolution of cultivated plants is continuing before our eyes, and the
 creations of Mr. Luther Burbank, such as the stoneless plum and the primus
 berry, the spineless cactus and the Shasta daisy, are merely striking
 instances of what is always going on.</p>

 <p>There is reason to believe that the domestic dog has risen three times,
 from three distinct ancestors&mdash;a wolf, a jackal, and a coyote. So a
 multiple pedigree must be allowed for in the case of the dog, and the same is
 true in regard to some other domesticated animals. But the big fact is the
 great variety of breeds that man has been able to fix, after he once got
 started with a domesticated type. There are over 200 well-marked breeds of
 domestic pigeons, and there is very strong evidence that all are descended
 from the wild rock-dove, just as the numerous kinds of poultry are descended
 from the jungle-fowl of some parts of India and the Malay Islands. Even more
 familiar is the way in which man has, so to speak, unpacked the complex fur
 of the wild rabbit, and established all the numerous colour-varieties which
 we see among domestic rabbits. And apart from colour-varieties there are
 long-haired Angoras and quaint lop-eared forms, and many more besides. All
 this points to evolution going on.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Romance of the Wheat</h4>

 <p>It is well-known that Neolithic man grew wheat, and some authorities have
 put the date of the first wheat harvest at between fifteen thousand and ten
 thousand years ago. The ancient civilisations<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> of Babylonia, Egypt, Crete,
 Greece, and Rome were largely based on wheat, and it is highly probable that
 the first great wheatfields were in the fertile land between the Tigris and
 the Euphrates. The oldest Egyptian tombs that contain wheat, which, by the
 way, never germinates after its millennia of rest, belong to the First
 Dynasty, and are about six thousand years old. But there must have been a
 long history of wheat before that.</p>

 <p>Now it is a very interesting fact that the almost certain ancestor of the
 cultivated wheat is at present living on the arid and rocky slopes of Mount
 Hermon. It is called <i>Triticum hermonis</i>, and it is varying notably
 to-day, as it did long ago when it gave rise to the emmer, which was
 cultivated in the Neolithic Age and is the ancestor of all our ordinary
 wheats. We must think of Neolithic man noticing the big seeds of this Hermon
 grass, gathering some of the heads, breaking the brittle spikelet-bearing
 axis in his fingers, knocking off the rough awns or bruising the spikelets in
 his hand till the glumes or chaff separated off and could be blown away,
 chewing a mouthful of the seeds&mdash;and resolving to sow and sow again.</p>

 <p>That was the beginning of a long story, in the course of which man took
 advantage of the numerous variations that cropped up in this sporting stock
 and established one successful race after another on his fields. Virgil
 refers in the &quot;Georgics&quot; to the gathering of the largest and
 fullest ears of wheat in order to get good seed for another sowing, but it
 was not till the first quarter of the nineteenth century that the great step
 was taken, by men like Patrick Sheriff of Haddington, of deliberately
 selecting individual ears of great excellence and segregating their progeny
 from mingling with mediocre stock. This is the method which has been followed
 with remarkable success in modern times.</p>

 <p>One of the factors that assisted the Allies in overcoming the food crisis
 in the darkest period of the war was the virtue of Marquis Wheat, a very
 prolific, early ripening, hard red spring wheat<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> with excellent milling and
 baking qualities. It is now the dominant spring wheat in Canada and the
 United States, and it has enormously increased the real wealth of the world
 in the last ten years (1921). Now our point is simply that this Marquis Wheat
 is a fine example of evolution going on. In 1917 upwards of 250,000,000
 bushels of this wheat were raised in North America, and in 1918 upwards of
 300,000,000 bushels; yet the whole originated from a single grain planted in
 an experimental plot at Ottawa by Dr. Charles E. Saunders so recently as the
 spring of 1903.</p>

 <p>We must not dwell too long on this particular instance of evolution,
 though it has meant much to our race. We wish, however, following Professor
 Buller&#39;s <i>Essays on Wheat</i> (1919), to explain the method by which
 this good seed was discovered. From one we may learn all. The parent of
 Marquis Wheat on the male side was the mid-Europe Red Fife&mdash;a
 first-class cereal. The parent on the female side was less promising, a
 rather nondescript, not pure-bred wheat, called Red Calcutta, which was
 imported from India into Canada about thirty years ago. The father was part
 of a cargo that came from the Baltic to Glasgow, and was happily included in
 a sample sent on to David Fife in Ontario about 1842. From one kernel of this
 sample David Fife started his stock of Red Fife, which was crossed by Dr.
 Saunders with Hard Red Calcutta. The result of the cross was a medley of
 types, nearly a hundred varieties altogether, and it was in scrutinising
 these that Dr. Saunders hit upon Marquis. He worked steadily through the
 material, studying head after head of what resulted from sowing, and
 selecting out those that gave most promise. Each of the heads selected was
 propagated; most of the results were rejected; the elect were sifted again
 and yet again, and finally Marquis Wheat emerged, rich in constructive
 possibilities, probably the most valuable food-plant in the world. It is like
 a romance to read that &quot;the first crop of the wheat that was destined
 within a dozen years to overtax the mightiest elevators<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> in the land
 was stored away in the winter of 1904-5 in a paper packet no larger than an
 envelope.&quot;</p>

 <p>Thus from the Wild Wheat of Mount Hermon there evolved one of the most
 important food-plants of the world. This surely is <i>Evolution going
 on</i>.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Changes in the Animal Life of a Country</h4>

 <p>Nothing gives us a more convincing impression of evolution in being than a
 succession of pictures of the animal life of a country in different ages. Dr.
 James Ritchie, a naturalist of distinction, has written a masterly book,
 <i>The Influence of Man on Animal Life in Scotland</i> (1920), in which we
 get this succession of pictures. &quot;Within itself,&quot; he says, &quot;a
 fauna is in a constant state of uneasy restlessness, an assemblage of
 creatures which in its parts ebbs and flows as one local influence or another
 plays upon it.&quot; There are temporary and local changes, endless
 disturbances and readjustments of the &quot;balance of nature.&quot; One year
 there is a plague of field-voles, perhaps next year &quot;grouse
 disease&quot; is rife; in one place there is huge increase of starlings, in
 another place of rabbits; here cockchafers are in the ascendant, and there
 the moles are spoiling the pasture. &quot;But while the parts fluctuate, the
 fauna as a whole follows a path of its own. As well as internal tides which
 swing to and fro about an average level, there is a drift which carries the
 fauna bodily along an &#39;irretraceable course.&#39;&quot; This is partly
 due to considerable changes of climate, for climate calls the tune to which
 living creatures dance, but it is also due to new departures among the
 animals themselves. We need not go back to the extinct animals and lost
 faunas of past ages&mdash;for Britain has plenty of relics of
 these&mdash;which &quot;illustrate the reality of the faunal drift,&quot; but
 it may be very useful, in illustration of evolution in being, to notice what
 has happened in Scotland since the end of the Great Ice Age.</p>

 <p>Some nine thousand years ago or more, certain long-headed,<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> square-jawed,
 short-limbed, but agile hunters and fishermen, whom we call Neolithic Man,
 established themselves in Scotland. What was the state of the country
 then?</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>It was a country of swamps, low forests of birch, alder, and willow,
  fertile meadows, and snow-capped mountains. Its estuaries penetrated further
  inland than they now do, and the sea stood at the level of the Fifty-Foot
  Beach. On its plains and in its forests roamed many creatures which are
  strange to the fauna of to-day&mdash;the Elk and the Reindeer, Wild Cattle,
  the Wild Boar and perhaps Wild Horses, a fauna of large animals which paid
  toll to the European Lynx, the Brown Bear and the Wolf. In all likelihood,
  the marshes resounded to the boom of the Bittern and the plains to the
  breeding calls of the Crane and the Great Bustard.</p>

 <p>Now what happened in this kingdom of Caledonia which Neolithic Man had
 found? He began to introduce domesticated animals, and that meant a thinning
 of the ranks of predacious creatures. &quot;Safety first&quot; was the
 dangerous motto in obedience to which man exterminated the lynx, the brown
 bear, and the wolf. Other creatures, such as the great auk, were destroyed
 for food, and others like the marten for their furs. Small pests were
 destroyed to protect the beginnings of agriculture; larger animals like the
 boar were hunted out of existence; others, like the pearl-bearing
 river-mussels, yielded to subtler demands. No doubt there was protection
 also&mdash;protection for sport, for utility, for æsthetic reasons, and
 because of humane sentiments; even wholesome superstitions have safeguarded
 the robin redbreast and the wren. There were introductions too&mdash;the
 rabbit for utility, the pheasant for sport, and the peacock for amenity. And
 every introduction, every protection, every killing out had its far-reaching
 influences.</p>

 <p>But if we are to picture the evolution going on, we must think also of
 man&#39;s indirect interference with animal life. He destroyed<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> the forests,
 he cultivated the wild, he made bridges, he allowed aliens, like rats and
 cockroaches, to get in unawares. Of course, he often did good, as when he
 drained swamps and got rid of the mosquitoes which once made malaria rife in
 Scotland.</p>

 <p>What has been the net result? Not, as one might think for a moment, a
 reduction in the <i>number</i> of different kinds of animals. Fourteen or so
 species of birds and beasts have been banished from Scotland since man
 interfered, but as far as numbers go they have been more than replaced by
 deliberate introductions like fallow deer, rabbit, squirrel, and pheasant,
 and by accidental introductions like rats and cockroaches. But the change is
 rather in <i>quality</i> than in quantity; the smaller have taken the place
 of the larger, rather paltry pigmies of noble giants. Thus we get a vivid
 idea that evolution, especially when man interferes, is not necessarily
 progressive. That depends on the nature of the sieves with which the living
 materials are sifted. As Dr. Ritchie well says, the standard of the wild
 fauna as regards size has fallen and is falling, and it is not in size only
 that there is loss, there is a deterioration of quality. &quot;For how can
 the increase of Rabbits and Sparrows and Earthworms and Caterpillars, and the
 addition of millions of Rats and Cochroaches and Crickets and Bugs, ever take
 the place of those fine creatures round the memories of which the glamour of
 Scotland&#39;s past still plays&mdash;the Reindeer and the Elk, the Wolf, the
 Brown Bear, the Lynx, and the Beaver, the Bustard, the Crane, the Bumbling
 Bittern, and many another, lost or disappearing.&quot; Thus we see again that
 evolution is going on.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 3</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Adventurers</h4>

 <p>All through the millions of years during which animals have tenanted the
 earth and the waters under the earth, there has been a search for new
 kingdoms to conquer, for new corners in which to make a home. And this still
 goes on. <i>It has been and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id=
 "Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> is one of the methods of evolution to fill
 every niche of opportunity.</i> There is a spider that lives inside a
 pitcher-plant, catching some of the inquisitive insects which slip down the
 treacherous internal surface of the trap. There is another that makes its
 home in crevices among the rocks on the shore of the Mediterranean, or even
 in empty tubular shells, keeping the water out, more or less successfully, by
 spinning threads of silk across the entrance to its retreat. The beautiful
 brine-shrimp, <i>Artemia salina</i>, that used to occur in British salterns
 has found a home in the dense waters of the Great Salt Lake of Utah. Several
 kinds of earthworms have been found up trees, and there is a fish, Arges,
 that climbs on the stones of steep mountain torrents of the Andes. The
 intrepid explorers of the <i>Scotia</i> voyage found quite a number of Arctic
 terns spending our winter within the summer of the Antarctic
 Circle&mdash;which means girdling the globe from pole to pole; and every now
 and then there are incursions of rare birds, like Pallas&#39;s Sand-grouse,
 into Britain, just as if they were prospecting in search of a promised land.
 Twice or thrice the distinctively North American Killdeer Plover has been
 found in Britain, having somehow or other got across the Atlantic. We miss
 part of the meaning of evolution if we do not catch this note of insurgence
 and adventure, which some animal or other never ceases to sound, though many
 establish themselves in a security not easily disturbed, and though a small
 minority give up the struggle against the stream and are content to
 acquiesce, as parasites or rottenness eaters, in a drifting life of ease.</p>

 <p>More important than very peculiar cases is the broad fact that over and
 over again in different groups of animals there have been attempts to master
 different kinds of haunts&mdash;such as the underground world, the trees, the
 freshwaters, and the air. There are burrowing amphibians, burrowing reptiles,
 burrowing birds, and burrowing mammals; there are tree-toads, tree-snakes,
 tree-lizards, tree-kangaroos, tree-sloths, tree-shrews, tree-mice,
 tree-porcupines, and so on; enough of a list to show, without<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> mentioning
 birds, how many different kinds of animals have entered upon an arboreal
 apprenticeship&mdash;an apprenticeship often with far-reaching consequences.
 What the freeing of the hand from being an organ of terrestrial support has
 meant in the evolution of monkeys is a question that gives a spur to our
 imagination.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Case of the Robber Crab</h4>

 <p>On some of the coral islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans there lives
 a land-crab, Birgus, which has learned to breathe on land. It breathes dry
 air by means of curious blood-containing tufts in the upper part of its
 gill-cavity, and it has also rudimentary gills. It is often about a foot
 long, and it has very heavy great claws, especially on the left-hand side.
 With this great claw it hammers on the &quot;eye-hole&quot; of a coconut,
 from which it has torn off the fibrous husk. It hammers until a hole is made
 by which it can get at the pulp. Part of the shell is sometimes used as a
 protection for the soft abdomen&mdash;for the robber-crab, as it is called,
 is an offshoot from the hermit-crab stock. Every year this quaint explorer,
 which may go far up the hills and climb the coco-palms, has to go back to the
 sea to spawn. The young ones are hatched in the same state as in our common
 shore-crab. That is to say, they are free-swimming larvæ which pass through
 an open-water period before they settle down on the shore, and eventually
 creep up on to dry land. Just as open-water turtles lay their eggs on sandy
 shores, going back to their old terrestrial haunt, so the robber-crab, which
 has almost conquered the dry land, has to return to the seashore to breed.
 There is a peculiar interest in the association of the robber-crab with the
 coco-palm, for that tree is not a native of these coral islands, but has been
 introduced, perhaps from Mexico, by the Polynesian mariners before the
 discovery of America by Columbus. So the learning to deal with coconuts is a
 recent achievement, and we are face to face with a very good example of
 evolution going on.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Story of the Salmon</h4>

 <p>In late autumn or in winter the salmon spawn in the rivers. The female
 makes a shallow trough in the gravel by moving her tail from side to side,
 and therein lays many eggs. The male, who is in attendance, fertilises these
 with the milt, and then the female covers them deeply with gravel. The
 process is repeated over and over again for a week or more till all the eggs
 are shed. For three to four months the eggs develop, and eventually there
 emerge the larvæ or <i>alevins</i>, which lurk among the pebbles. They cannot
 swim much, for they are encumbered by a big legacy of yolk. In a few weeks,
 perhaps eight, the protruding bag of yolk has disappeared and the <i>fry</i>,
 about an inch long, begin to move about more actively and to fend for
 themselves. By the end of the year they have grown to be rather trout-like
 <i>parr</i>, about four inches long. In two years these are double that
 length. Usually in the second year, but it may be earlier or later, the parr
 become silvery <i>smolts</i>, which go out to sea, usually about the month of
 May. They feed on young herring and the like and grow large and strong. When
 they are about three and a half years old they come up the rivers as
 <i>grilse</i> and may spawn. Or they may pass through the whole grilse stage
 in the sea and come up the rivers with all the characters of the full-grown
 fish. In many cases the salmon spawn only once, and some (they are called
 <i>kelts</i> after spawning) are so much exhausted by starting a new
 generation that they die or fall a victim to otters and other enemies. In the
 case of the salmon of the North Pacific (in the genus <i>Oncorhynchus</i>,
 not <i>Salmo</i>) all the individuals die after spawning, none being able to
 return to the sea. It must be remembered that full-grown salmon do not as a
 rule feed in fresh water, though they may be unable to resist snapping at the
 angler&#39;s strange creations. A very interesting fact is that the salmon
 keeps as it were a diary of its movements, which vary a good deal in
 different rivers. This diary is written in the scales, and a careful reading
 of the concentric lines on the scales shows the age of the fish,
 and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
 when it went out to sea, and whether it has spawned or not, and more
 besides.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Interpretation of the Salmon&#39;s Story</h4>

 <p>When an animal frequents two different haunts, in one of which it breeds,
 it is very often safe to say that the breeding-place represents the original
 home. The flounder is quite comfortable far up the rivers, but it has to go
 to the shore-waters to spawn, and there is no doubt that the flounder is a
 marine fish which has recently learned to colonise the fresh waters. Its
 relatives, like plaice and sole, are strictly marine. But it is impossible to
 make a dogma of the rule that the breeding-place corresponds to the original
 home. Thus some kinds of bass, which belong to the marine family of
 sea-perches, live in the sea or in estuaries, while two have become permanent
 residents in fresh water. Or, again, the members of the herring family are
 very distinctively marine, but the shad, which belong to this family, spawn
 in rivers and may spend their lives there.</p>

 <p>So there are two different ways of interpreting the life-history of the
 salmon. Some authorities regard the salmon as a marine fish which is
 establishing itself in fresh water. But others read the story the other way
 and regard the salmon as a member of a freshwater race, that has taken to the
 sea for feeding purposes. In regard to trout, we know that the ranks of those
 in rivers and lakes are continually being reinforced by migrants from the
 sea, and that some trout go down to the sea while others remain in the
 freshwater. We know also in regard to a related fish, the char, that while
 the great majority of kinds are now permanent residents in cold and deep,
 isolated northern lakes, there are Arctic forms which live in the sea but
 enter the rivers to spawn. These facts favour the view that the salmon was
 originally a marine fish. But there are arguments on both sides, and, for our
 present purpose, the important fact is that the salmon is conquering
 <i>two</i> haunts. Its evolution is going on.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Romance of the Eel</h4>

 <p>Early in summer, at dates varying with the distance of the rivers from the
 open Atlantic, crowds of young eels or elvers come up-stream. Sometimes the
 procession or eel-fare includes thousands of individuals, each about the
 length of our first finger, and as thick as a stout knitting needle. They
 obey an inborn impulse to swim against the stream, seeking automatically to
 have both sides of their body equally stimulated by the current. So they go
 straight ahead. The obligation works only during the day, for when the sun
 goes down behind the hills the elvers snuggle under stones or beneath the
 bank and rest till dawn. In the course of time they reach the quiet upper
 reaches of the river or go up rivulets and drainpipes to the isolated ponds.
 Their impulse to go on must be very imperious, for they may wriggle up the
 wet moss by the side of a waterfall or even make a short excursion in a damp
 meadow.</p>

 <p>In the quiet-flowing stretches of the river or in the ponds they feed and
 grow for years and years. They account for a good many young fishes.
 Eventually, after five or six years in the case of the males, six to eight
 years in the case of the females, the well-grown fishes, perhaps a foot and a
 half to two feet long, are seized by a novel restlessness. They are beginning
 to be mature. They put on a silvery jacket and become large of eye, and they
 return to the sea. In getting away from the pond it may be necessary to
 wriggle through the damp meadow-grass before reaching the river. They travel
 by night and rather excitedly. The Arctic Ocean is too cold for them and the
 North Sea too shallow. They must go far out to sea, to where the old margin
 of the once larger continent of Europe slopes down to the great abysses, from
 the Hebrides southwards. Eels seem to spawn in the deep dark water; but the
 just liberated eggs have not yet been found. The young fry rises to near the
 surface and becomes a knife-blade-like larva, transparent all but its eye. It
 lives for many months in this state, growing to be about three inches long,
 rising and sinking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg
 200]</a></span> in the water, and swimming gently. These open-sea young eels
 are known as Leptocephali, a name given to them before their real nature was
 proved. They gradually become shorter, and the shape changes from
 knife-blade-like to cylindrical. During this change they fast, and the weight
 of their delicate body decreases. They turn into glass-eels, about 2½ inches
 long, like a knitting-needle in girth. They begin to move towards the distant
 shores and rivers, and they may be a year and a half old before they reach
 their destination and go up-stream as elvers. Those that ascend the rivers of
 the Eastern Baltic must have journeyed three thousand miles. It is certain
 that no eel ever matures or spawns in fresh water. It is practically certain
 that all the young eels ascending the rivers of North Europe have come in
 from the Atlantic, some of them perhaps from the Azores or further out still.
 It is interesting to inquire how the young eels circumvent the Falls of the
 Rhine and get into Lake Constance, or how their kindred on the other side of
 the Atlantic overcome the obstacle of Niagara; but it is more important to
 lay emphasis on the variety of habitats which this fish is trying&mdash;the
 deep waters, the open sea, the shore, the river, the pond, and even, it may
 be, a little taste of solid earth. It seems highly probable that the common
 eel is a deep-water marine fish which has learned to colonise the
 freshwaters. It has been adventurous and it has succeeded. The only shadow on
 the story of achievement is that there seems to be no return from the
 spawning. There is little doubt that death is the nemesis of their
 reproduction. In any case, no adult eel ever comes back from the deep sea. We
 are minded of Goethe&#39;s hard saying: &quot;Death is Nature&#39;s expert
 advice to get plenty of life.&quot;</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Forming New Habits</h4>

 <p>There is a well-known mudfish of Australia, Neoceratodus by name, which
 has turned its swim-bladder into a lung and comes to the surface to spout. It
 expels vitiated air with considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201"
 id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> force and takes fresh gulps. At the same
 time, like an ordinary fish, it has gills which allow the usual interchange
 of gases between the blood and the water. Now this Australian mudfish or
 double-breather (Dipnoan), which may be a long way over a yard in length, is
 a direct and little-changed descendant of an ancient extinct fish, Ceratodus,
 which lived in Mesozoic times, as far back as the Jurassic, which probably
 means over five millions of years ago. The Queensland mudfish is an
 antiquity, and there has not been much change in its lineage for millions of
 years. We might take it as an illustration of the inertia of evolution. And
 yet, though its structure has changed but little, the fish probably
 illustrates evolution in process, for it is a fish that is learning to
 breathe dry air. It cannot leave the water; but it can live comfortably in
 pools which are foul with decomposing animal and vegetable matter. In
 partially dried-up and foul waterholes, full of dead fishes of various kinds,
 Neoceratodus has been found vigorous and lively. Unless we take the view,
 which is <i>possible</i>, that the swim-bladder of fishes was originally a
 lung, the mud-fishes are learning to breathe dry air. They illustrate
 evolution agoing.</p>

 <p class="wide">The herring-gull is by nature a fish-eater; but of recent
 years, in some parts of Britain, it has been becoming in the summer months
 more and more of a vegetarian, scooping out the turnips, devouring potatoes,
 settling on the sheaves in the harvest field and gorging itself with grain.
 Similar experiments, usually less striking, are known in many birds; but the
 most signal illustration is that of the kea or Nestor parrot of New Zealand,
 which has taken to lighting on the loins of the sheep, tearing away the
 fleece, cutting at the skin, and gouging out fat. Now the parrot belongs to a
 vegetarian or frugivorous stock, and this change of diet in the relatively
 short time since sheep-ranches were established in New Zealand is very
 striking. Here, since we know the dates, we may speak of evolution going on
 under our eyes. It must be remembered that variations in habit may give
 an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
 animal a new opportunity to test variations in structure which arise
 mysteriously from within, as expressions of germinal changefulness rather
 than as imprints from without. For of the transmissibility of the latter
 there is little secure evidence.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Experiments in Locomotion</h4>

 <p>It is very interesting to think of the numerous types of locomotion which
 animals have discovered&mdash;pulling and punting, sculling and rowing, and
 of the changes that are rung on these four main methods. How striking is the
 case of the frilled lizard (Chlamydosaurus) of Australia, which at the
 present time is, as it were, experimenting in bipedal
 progression&mdash;always a rather eventful thing to do. It gets up on its
 hind-legs and runs totteringly for a few feet, just like a baby learning to
 walk.</p>

 <p>How beautiful is the adventure which has led our dipper or
 water-ouzel&mdash;a bird allied to the wrens&mdash;to try walking and flying
 under water! How admirable is the volplaning of numerous
 parachutists&mdash;&quot;flying fish,&quot; &quot;flying frog,&quot;
 &quot;flying dragon,&quot; &quot;flying phalanger,&quot; &quot;flying
 squirrel,&quot; and more besides, which take great leaps through the air. For
 are these not the splendid failures that might have succeeded in starting new
 modes of flight?</p>

 <p>Most daring of all, perhaps, are the aerial journeys undertaken by many
 small spiders. On a breezy morning, especially in the autumn, they mount on
 gate-posts and palings and herbage, and, standing with their head to the
 wind, pay out three or four long threads of silk. When the wind tugs at these
 threads, the spinners let go, and are borne, usually back downwards, on the
 wings of the wind from one parish to another. It is said that if the wind
 falls they can unfurl more sail, or furl if it rises. In any case, these
 wingless creatures make aerial journeys. When tens of thousands of the used
 threads sink to earth, there is a &quot;shower of gossamer.&quot; On his
 <i>Beagle</i> voyage Darwin observed that vast numbers of small gossamer
 spiders were borne on to the ship when it was sixty miles distant from the
 land.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">New Devices</h4>

 <p>It is impossible, we must admit, to fix dates, except in a few cases,
 relatively recent; but there is a smack of modernity in some striking devices
 which we can observe in operation to-day. Thus no one will dispute the
 statement that spiders are thoroughly terrestrial animals breathing dry air,
 but we have the fact of the water-spider conquering the under-water world.
 There are a few spiders about the seashore, and a few that can survive
 douching with freshwater, but the particular case of the true water-spider,
 <i>Argyroneta natans</i>, stands by itself because the creature, as regards
 the female at least, has <i>conquered</i> the sub-aquatic environment. A
 flattish web is woven, somehow, underneath the water, and pegged down by
 threads of silk. Along a special vertical line the mother spider ascends to
 the surface and descends again, having entangled air in the hairs of her
 body. She brushes off this air underneath her web, which is thereby buoyed up
 into a sort of dome. She does this over and over again, never getting wet all
 the time, until the domed web has become like a diving-bell, full of dry air.
 In this eloquent anticipation of man&#39;s rational device, this
 creature&mdash;far from being endowed with reason&mdash;lays her eggs and
 looks after her young. The general significance of the facts is that when
 competition is keen, a new area of exploitation is a promised land. Thus
 spiders have spread over all the earth except the polar areas. But here is a
 spider with some spirit of adventure, which has endeavoured, instead of
 trekking, to find a new corner near at home. It has tackled a problem surely
 difficult for a terrestrial animal, the problem of living in great part under
 water, and it has solved it in a manner at once effective and beautiful.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">In Conclusion</h4>

 <p>We have given but a few representative illustrations of a great theme.
 When we consider the changefulness of living creatures, the transformations
 of cultivated plants and domesticated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204"

 fauna of a country, the search after new haunts, the forming of new habits,

 <h2>THE DAWN OF MIND</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>THE DAWN OF MIND</h3>

 <p>In the story of evolution there is no chapter more interesting than the
 emergence of mind in the animal kingdom. But it is a difficult chapter to
 read, partly because &quot;mind&quot; cannot be seen or measured, only
 <i>inferred</i> from the outward behaviour of the creature, and partly
 because it is almost impossible to avoid reading ourselves into the much
 simpler animals.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Two Extremes to be Avoided</h4>

 <p>The one extreme is that of uncritical generosity which credits every
 animal, like Brer Rabbit&mdash;who, by the way, was the hare&mdash;with human
 qualities. The other extreme is that of thinking of the animal as if it were
 an automatic machine, in the working of which there is no place or use for
 mind. Both these extremes are to be avoided.</p>

 <p>When Professor Whitman took the eggs of the Passenger Pigeon (which became
 extinct not long ago with startling rapidity) and placed them a few inches to
 one side of the nest, the bird looked a little uneasy and put her beak under
 her body as if to feel for something that was not there. But she did not try
 to retrieve her eggs, close at hand as they were. In a short time she flew
 away altogether. This shows that the mind of the pigeon is in some respects
 very different from the mind of man. On the other hand, when a certain clever
 dog, carrying a basket of eggs, with the handle in his mouth, came to a stile
 which had to be negotiated, he laid the basket on the ground, pushed it
 gently through a low gap to the other side, and then took a running leap
 over. We dare not talk of this dog as an automatic machine.<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

 <h4 class="sect">A Caution in Regard to Instinct</h4>

 <p>In studying the behaviour of animals, which is the only way of getting at
 their mind, for it is only of our own mind that we have direct knowledge, it
 is essential to give prominence to the fact that there has been throughout
 the evolution of living creatures a strong tendency to enregister or engrain
 capacities of doing things effectively. Thus certain abilities come to be
 inborn; they are parts of the inheritance, which will express themselves
 whenever the appropriate trigger is pulled. The newly born child does not
 require to learn its breathing movements, as it afterwards requires to learn
 its walking movements. The ability to go through the breathing movements is
 inborn, engrained, enregistered.</p>

 <p>In other words, there are hereditary pre-arrangements of nerve-cells and
 muscle-cells which come into activity almost as easily as the beating of the
 heart. In a minute or two the newborn pigling creeps close to its mother and
 sucks milk. It has not to learn how to do this any more than we have to learn
 to cough or sneeze. Thus animals have many useful ready-made, or almost
 ready-made, capacities of doing apparently clever things. In simple cases of
 these inborn pre-arrangements we speak of reflex actions; in more complicated
 cases, of instinctive behaviour. Now the caution is this, that while these
 inborn capacities usually work well in natural conditions, they sometimes
 work badly when the ordinary routine is disturbed. We see this when a pigeon
 continues sitting for many days on an empty nest, or when it fails to
 retrieve its eggs only two inches away. But it would be a mistake to call the
 pigeon, because of this, an unutterably stupid bird. We have only to think of
 the achievements of homing pigeons to know that this cannot be true. We must
 not judge animals in regard to those kinds of behaviour which have been
 handed over to instinct, and go badly agee when the normal routine is
 disturbed. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the enregistered instinctive
 capacities work well, and the advantage of<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> their becoming stereotyped was
 to leave the animal more free for adventures at a higher level. Being &quot;a
 slave of instinct&quot; may give the animal a security that enables it to
 discover some new home or new food or new joy. Somewhat in the same way, a
 man of methodical habits, which he has himself established, may gain leisure
 to make some new departure of racial profit.</p>

 <p>When we draw back our finger from something very hot, or shut our eye to
 avoid a blow from a rebounding branch, we do not will the action; and this is
 more or less the case, probably, when a young mammal sucks its mother for the
 first time. Some Mound-birds of Celebes lay their eggs in warm volcanic ash
 by the shore of the sea, others in a great mass of fermenting vegetation; it
 is inborn in the newly hatched bird to struggle out as quickly as it can from
 such a strange nest, else it will suffocate. If it stops struggling too soon,
 it perishes, for it seems that the trigger of the instinct cannot be pulled
 twice. Similarly, when the eggs of the turtle, that have been laid in the
 sand of the shore, hatch out, the young ones make <i>instinctively</i> for
 the sea. Some of the crocodiles bury their eggs two feet or so below the
 surface among sand and decaying vegetation&mdash;an awkward situation for a
 birthplace. When the young crocodile is ready to break out of the egg-shell,
 just as a chick does at the end of the three weeks of brooding, it utters
 <i>instinctively</i> a piping cry. On hearing this, the watchful mother digs
 away the heavy blankets, otherwise the young crocodile would be buried alive
 at birth. Now there is no warrant for believing that the young Mound-birds,
 young crocodiles, and young turtles have an intelligent appreciation of what
 they do when they are hatched. They act instinctively, &quot;as to the manner
 born.&quot; But this is not to say that their activity is not backed by
 endeavour or even suffused with a certain amount of awareness. Of course, it
 is necessarily difficult for man, who is so much a creature of intelligence,
 to get even an inkling of the mental side of instinctive behaviour.</p>

 <p>In many of the higher reaches of animal instinct, as in
 courtship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg
 210]</a></span> or nest-building, in hunting or preparing the food, it looks
 as if the starting of the routine activity also &quot;rang up&quot; the
 higher centres of the brain and put the intelligence on the <i>qui vive</i>,
 ready to interpose when needed. So the twofold caution is this: (1) We must
 not depreciate the creature too much if, in unusual circumstances, it acts in
 an ineffective way along lines of behaviour which are normally handed over to
 instinct; and (2) we must leave open the possibility that even routine
 instinctive behaviour may be suffused with awareness and backed by
 endeavour.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 2</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">A Useful Law</h4>

 <p>But how are we to know when to credit the animal with intelligence and
 when with something less spontaneous? Above all, how are we to know when the
 effective action, like opening the mouth the very instant it is touched by
 food in the mother&#39;s beak, is just a physiological action like coughing
 or sneezing, and when there is behind it&mdash;a mind at work? The answer to
 this question is no doubt that given by Prof. Lloyd Morgan, who may be called
 the founder of comparative psychology, that we must describe the piece of
 behaviour very carefully, just as it occurred, without reading anything into
 it, and that we must not ascribe it to a higher faculty if it can be
 satisfactorily accounted for in terms of a lower one. In following this
 principle we may be sometimes niggardly, for the behaviour may have a mental
 subtlety that we have missed; but in nine cases out of ten our conclusions
 are likely to be sound. It is the critical, scientific way.</p>

 <p>Bearing this law in mind, let us take a survey of the emergence of mind
 among backboned animals.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Senses of Fishes</h4>

 <p>Fishes cannot shut their eyes, having no true lids; but the eyes
 themselves are very well developed and the vision is acute,<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> especially for
 moving objects. Except in gristly fishes, the external opening to the ear has
 been lost, so that sound-waves and coarser vibrations must influence the
 inner ear, which is well developed, through the surrounding flesh and bones.
 It seems that the main use of the ear in fishes is in connection with
 balancing, not with hearing. In many cases, however, the sense of hearing has
 been demonstrated; thus fishes will come to the side of a pond to be fed when
 a bell is rung or when a whistle is blown by someone not visible from the
 water. The fact that many fishes pay no attention at all to loud noises does
 not prove that they are deaf, for an animal may hear a sound and yet remain
 quite indifferent or irresponsive. This merely means that the sound has no
 vital interest for the animal. Some fishes, such as bullhead and dogfish,
 have a true sense of smell, detecting by their nostrils very dilute
 substances permeating the water from a distance. Others, such as members of
 the cod family, perceive their food in part at least by the sense of taste,
 which is susceptible to substances near at hand and present in considerable
 quantity. This sense of taste may be located on the fins as well as about the
 mouth. At this low level the senses of smell and taste do not seem to be very
 readily separated. The chief use of the sensitive line or lateral line seen
 on each side of a bony fish is to make the animal aware of slow vibrations
 and changes of pressure in the water. The skin responds to pressures, the ear
 to vibrations of high frequency; the lateral line is between the two in its
 function.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Interesting Ways of Fishes</h4>

 <p>The brain of the ordinary bony fish is at a very low level. Thus the
 cerebral hemispheres, destined to become more and more the seat of
 intelligence, are poorly developed. In gristly fishes, like skates and
 sharks, the brain is much more promising. But although the state of the brain
 does not lead one to expect very much from a bony fish like trout or eel,
 haddock or herring, illustrations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id=
 "Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> are not wanting of what might be called pretty
 pieces of behaviour. Let us select a few cases.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Stickleback&#39;s Nest</h4>

 <p>The three-spined and two-spined sticklebacks live equally well in fresh or
 salt water; the larger fifteen-spined stickleback is entirely marine. In all
 three species the male fish makes a nest, in fresh or brackish water in the
 first two cases, in shore-pools in the third case. The little species use the
 leaves and stems of water-plants; the larger species use seaweed and
 zoophyte. The leaves or fronds are entangled together and fastened by
 glue-like threads, secreted, strange to say, by the kidneys. It is just as if
 a temporary diseased condition had been regularised and turned to good
 purpose. Going through the nest several times, the male makes a little room
 in the middle. Partly by coercion and partly by coaxing he induces a
 female&mdash;first one and then another&mdash;to pass through the nest with
 two doors, depositing eggs during her short sojourn. The females go their
 way, and the male mounts guard over the nest. He drives off intruding fishes
 much bigger than himself. When the young are hatched, the male has for a time
 much to do, keeping his charges within bounds until they are able to move
 about with agility. It seems that sticklebacks are short-lived fishes,
 probably breeding only once; and it is reasonable to suppose that their
 success as a race depends to some extent on the paternal care. Now if we
 could believe that the nesting behaviour had appeared suddenly in its present
 form, we should be inclined to credit the fish with considerable mental
 ability. But we are less likely to be so generous if we reflect that the
 routine has been in all likelihood the outcome of a long racial process of
 slight improvements and critical testings. The secretion of the glue probably
 came about as a pathological variation; its utilisation was perhaps
 discovered by accident; the types that had wit enough to take advantage of
 this were most successful; the routine became enregistered hereditarily. The
 stickleback is not so clever as it looks.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Mind of a Minnow</h4>

 <p>To find solid ground on which to base an appreciation of the behaviour of
 fishes, it is necessary to experiment, and we may refer to Miss Gertrude
 White&#39;s interesting work on American minnows and sticklebacks. After the
 fishes had become quite at home in their artificial surroundings, their
 lessons began. Cloth packets, one of which contained meat and the other
 cotton, were suspended at opposite ends of the aquarium. The mud-minnows did
 not show that they perceived either packet, though they swam close by them;
 the sticklebacks were intrigued at once. Those that went towards the packet
 containing meat darted furiously upon it and pulled at it with great
 excitement. Those that went towards the cotton packet turned sharply away
 when they were within about two inches off. They then perceived what those at
 the other end were after and joined them&mdash;a common habit amongst fishes.
 Although the minnows were not interested in the tiny &quot;bags of
 mystery,&quot; they were even more alert than the sticklebacks in perceiving
 moving objects in or on the water, and there is no doubt that both these
 shallow-water species discover their food largely by sense of sight.</p>

 <p>The next set of lessons had to do with colour-associations. The fishes
 were fed on minced snail, chopped earthworm, fragments of liver, and the
 like, and the food was given to them from the end of forceps held above the
 surface of the water, so that the fishes could not be influenced by smell.
 They had to leap out of the water to take the food from the forceps. Discs of
 coloured cardboard were slipped over the end of the forceps, so that what the
 fishes saw was a morsel of food in the centre of a coloured disc. After a
 week or so of preliminary training, they were so well accustomed to the
 coloured discs that the presentation of one served as a signal for the fishes
 to dart to the surface and spring out of the water. When baits of paper were
 substituted for the food, the fishes continued to jump at the discs. When,
 however, a blue disc was persistently used for the paper bait and a red
 disc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg
 214]</a></span> for the real food, or <i>vice versa</i>, some of the minnows
 learned to discriminate infallibly between shadow and substance, both when
 these were presented alternately and when they were presented simultaneously.
 This is not far from the dawn of mind.</p>

 <p>In the course of a few lessons, both minnows and sticklebacks learned to
 associate particular colours with food, and other associations were also
 formed. A kind of larva that a minnow could make nothing of after repeated
 trials was subsequently ignored. The approach of the experimenter or anyone
 else soon began to serve as a food-signal. There can be no doubt that in the
 ordinary life of fishes there is a process of forming useful associations and
 suppressing useless responses. Given an inborn repertory of profitable
 movements that require no training, given the power of forming associations
 such as those we have illustrated, and given a considerable degree of sensory
 alertness along certain lines, fishes do not require much more. And in truth
 they have not got it. Moving with great freedom in three dimensions in a
 medium that supports them and is very uniform and constant, able in most
 cases to get plenty of food without fatiguing exertions and to dispense with
 it for considerable periods if it is scarce, multiplying usually in great
 abundance so that the huge infantile mortality hardly counts, rarely dying a
 natural death but usually coming with their strength unabated to a violent
 end, fishes hold their own in the struggle for existence without much in the
 way of mental endowment. Their brain has more to do with motion than with
 mentality, and they have remained at a low psychical level.</p>

 <p>Yet just as we should greatly misjudge our own race if we confined our
 attention to everyday routine, so in our total, as distinguished from our
 average, estimate of fishes, we must remember the salmon surmounting the
 falls, the wary trout eluding the angler&#39;s skill, the common mud-skipper
 (Periophthalmus) of many tropical shores which climbs on the rocks and the
 roots of the mangrove-trees, or actively hunts small shore-animals.
 We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
 must remember the adventurous life-history of the eel and the quaint ways in
 which some fishes, males especially, look after their family. The male
 sea-horse puts the eggs in his breast-pocket; the male Kurtus carries them on
 the top of his head; the cock-paidle or lumpsucker guards them and aerates
 them in a corner of a shore-pool.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 3</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Mind of Amphibians</h4>

 <p>Towards the end of the age of the Old Red Sandstone or Devonian, a great
 step in evolution was taken&mdash;the emergence of Amphibians. The earliest
 representatives had fish-like characters even more marked than those which
 may be discerned in the tadpoles of our frogs and toads, and there is no
 doubt that amphibians sprang from a fish stock. But they made great strides,
 associated in part with their attempts to get out of the water on to dry
 land. From fossil forms we cannot say much in regard to soft parts; but if we
 consider the living representatives of the class, we may credit amphibians
 with such important acquisitions as fingers and toes, a three-chambered
 heart, true ventral lungs, a drum to the ear, a mobile tongue, and vocal
 cords. When animals began to be able to grasp an object and when they began
 to be able to utter sufficient sounds, two new doors were opened. Apart from
 insects, whose instrumental music had probably begun before the end of the
 Devonian age, amphibians were the first animals to have a voice. The primary
 meaning of this voice was doubtless, as it is to-day in our frogs, a
 sex-call; but it was the beginning of what was destined to play a very
 important part in the evolution of the mind. In the course of ages the
 significance of the voice broadened out; it became a parental call; it became
 an infant&#39;s cry. Broadening still, it became a very useful means of
 recognition among kindred, especially in the dark and in the intricacies of
 the forest. Ages passed, and the voice rose on another turn of the
 evolutionary spiral to be expressive of particular<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> emotions
 beyond the immediate circle of sex&mdash;emotions of joy and of fear, of
 jealousy and of contentment. Finally, we judge, the animal&mdash;perhaps the
 bird was first&mdash;began to give utterance to particular &quot;words,&quot;
 indicative not merely of emotions, but of particular things with an emotional
 halo, such as &quot;food,&quot; &quot;enemy,&quot; &quot;home.&quot; Long
 afterwards, words became <i>in man</i> the medium of reasoned discourse.
 Sentences were made and judgments expressed. But was not the beginning in the
 croaking of Amphibia?</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Senses of Amphibians</h4>

 <p>Frogs have good eyes, and the toad&#39;s eyes are &quot;jewels.&quot;
 There is evidence of precise vision in the neat way in which a frog catches a
 fly, flicking out its tongue, which is fixed in front and loose behind. There
 is also experimental proof that a frog discriminates between red and blue, or
 between red and white, and an interesting point is that while our skin is
 sensitive to heat rays but not to light, the skin of the frog answers back to
 light rays as well. Professor Yerkes experimented with a frog which had to go
 through a simple labyrinth if it wished to reach a tank of water. At the
 first alternative between two paths, a red card was placed on the wrong side
 and a white one on the other. When the frog had learned to take the correct
 path, marked by the white card, Prof. Yerkes changed the cards. The confusion
 of the frog showed how thoroughly it had learned its lesson.</p>

 <p>We know very little in regard to sense of smell or taste in amphibians;
 but the sense of hearing is well developed, more developed than might be
 inferred from the indifference that frogs show to almost all sounds except
 the croaking of their kindred and splashes in the water.</p>

 <p>The toad looks almost sagacious when it is climbing up a bank, and some of
 the tree-frogs are very alert; but there is very little that we dare say
 about the amphibian mind. We have mentioned that frogs may learn the secret
 of a simple maze, and toads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id=
 "Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> sometimes make for a particular spawning-pond
 from a considerable distance. But an examination of their brains, occupying a
 relatively small part of the broad, flat skull, warns us not to expect much
 intelligence. On the other hand, when we take frogs along a line that is very
 vital to them, namely, the discrimination of palatable and unpalatable
 insects, we find, by experiment, that they are quick to learn and that they
 remember their lessons for many days. Frogs sometimes deposit their eggs in
 very unsuitable pools of water; but perhaps that is not quite so stupid as it
 looks. The egg-laying is a matter that has been, as it were, handed over to
 instinctive registration.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Experiments in Parental Care</h4>

 <p>It must be put to the credit of amphibians that they have made many
 experiments in methods of parental care, as if they were feeling their way to
 new devices. A common frog lays her clumps of eggs in the cradle of the
 water, sometimes far over a thousand together; the toad winds two long
 strings round and between water-weeds; and in both cases that is all. There
 is no parental care, and the prolific multiplication covers the enormous
 infantile mortality. This is the spawning solution of the problem of securing
 the continuance of the race. But there is another solution, that of parental
 care associated with an economical reduction of the number of eggs. Thus the
 male of the Nurse-Frog (Alytes), not uncommon on the Continent, fixes a
 string of twenty to fifty eggs to the upper part of his hind-legs, and
 retires to his hole, only coming out at night to get some food and to keep up
 the moisture about the eggs. In three weeks, when the tadpoles are ready to
 come out, he plunges into the pond and is freed from his living burden and
 his family cares. In the case of the thoroughly aquatic Surinam Toad (Pipa),
 the male helps to press the eggs, perhaps a hundred in number, on to the back
 of the female, where each sinks into a pocket of skin with a little lid. By
 and by fully formed young toads jump out of the pockets.<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

 <p>In the South American tree-frogs called Nototrema there is a pouch on the
 back of the female in which the eggs develop, and it is interesting to find
 that in some species what come out are ordinary tadpoles, while in other
 species the young emerge as miniatures of their parents. Strangest of all,
 perhaps, is the case of Darwin&#39;s Frog (Rhinoderma of Chili), where the
 young, about ten to fifteen in number, develop in the male&#39;s
 croaking-sacs, which become in consequence enormously distended. Eventually
 the strange spectacle is seen of miniature frogs jumping out of their
 father&#39;s mouth. Needless to say we are not citing these methods of
 parental care as examples of intelligence; but perhaps they correct the
 impression of amphibians as a rather humdrum race. Whatever be the mental
 aspect of the facts, there has certainly been some kind of experimenting, and
 the increase of parental care, so marked in many amphibians, with associated
 reduction of the number of offspring is a finger-post on the path of
 progress.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 4</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Reptilian Mind</h4>

 <p>We speak of the wisdom of the serpent; but it is not very easy to justify
 the phrase. Among all the multitude of reptiles&mdash;snakes, lizards,
 turtles, and crocodiles, a motley crowd&mdash;we cannot see much more than
 occasional traces of intelligence. The inner life remains a tiny rill.</p>

 <p>No doubt many reptiles are very effective; but it is an instinctive rather
 than an intelligent efficiency. The well-known &quot;soft-shell&quot;
 tortoise of the United States swims with powerful strokes and runs so quickly
 that it can hardly be overtaken. It hunts vigorously for crayfish and insect
 larvæ in the rivers. It buries itself in the mud when cold weather comes. It
 may lie on a floating log ready to slip into the water at a moment&#39;s
 notice; it may bask on a sunny bank or in the warm shallows. Great wariness
 is shown in choosing times and places for egg-laying. The mother tramps the
 earth down upon the buried eggs. All is effective.<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> Similar
 statements might be made in regard to scores of other reptiles; but what we
 see is almost wholly of the nature of instinctive routine, and we get little
 glimpse of more than efficiency and endeavour.</p>

 <p>In a few cases there is proof of reptiles finding their way back to their
 homes from a considerable distance, and recognition of persons is
 indubitable. Gilbert White remarks of his tortoise: &quot;Whenever the good
 old lady came in sight who had waited on it for more than thirty years, it
 always hobbled with awkward alacrity towards its benefactress, while to
 strangers it was altogether inattentive.&quot; Of definite learning there are
 a few records. Thus Professor Yerkes studied a sluggish turtle of retiring
 disposition, taking advantage of its strong desire to efface itself. On the
 path of the darkened nest of damp grass he interposed a simple maze in the
 form of a partitioned box. After wandering about constantly for thirty-five
 minutes the turtle found its way through the maze by chance. Two hours
 afterwards it reached the nest in fifteen minutes; and after another interval
 of two hours it only required five minutes. After the third trial, the routes
 became more direct, there was less aimless wandering. The time of the
 twentieth trial was forty-five seconds; that of the thirtieth, forty seconds.
 In the thirtieth case, the path followed was quite direct, and so it was on
 the fiftieth trip, which only required thirty-five seconds. Of course, the
 whole thing did not amount to very much; but there was a definite learning,
 <i>a learning from experience</i>, which has played an important part in the
 evolution of animal behaviour.</p>

 <p>Comparing reptiles with amphibians, we may recognise an increased
 masterliness of behaviour and a hint of greater plasticity. The records of
 observers who have made pets of reptiles suggest that the life of feeling or
 emotion is growing stronger, and so do stories, if they can be accepted,
 which suggest the beginning of conjugal affection.</p>

 <p>The error must be guarded against of interpreting in terms<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> of
 intelligence what is merely the outcome of long-continued structure
 adaptation. When the limbless lizard called the Slow-worm is suddenly seized
 by the tail, it escapes by surrendering the appendage, which breaks across a
 preformed weak plane. But this is a reflex action, not a reflective one. It
 is comparable to our sudden withdrawal of our finger from a very hot cinder.
 The Egg-eating African snake Dasypeltis gets the egg of a bird into its
 gullet unbroken, and cuts the shell against downward-projecting sharp points
 of the vertebræ. None of the precious contents is lost and the broken
 &quot;empties&quot; are returned. It is admirable, indeed unsurpassable; but
 it is not intelligent.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 5</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Mind in Birds</h4>

 <p>Sight and hearing are highly developed in birds, and the senses, besides
 pulling the triggers of inborn efficiencies, supply the raw materials for
 intelligence. There is some truth, though not the whole truth, in the old
 philosophical dictum, that there is nothing in the intellect which was not
 previously in the senses. Many people have admired the certainty and alacrity
 with which gulls pick up a fragment of biscuit from the white wake of a
 steamer, and the incident is characteristic. In their power of rapidly
 altering the focus of the eye, birds are unsurpassed.</p>

 <p>To the sense of sight in birds, the sense of hearing comes a good second.
 A twig breaks under our feet, and out sounds the danger-call of the bird we
 were trying to watch. Many young birds, like partridges, respond when two or
 three hours old to the anxious warning note of the parents, and squat
 motionless on the ground, though other sounds, such as the excited clucking
 of a foster-mother hen, leave them indifferent. They do not know what they
 are doing when they squat; they are obeying the living hand of the past which
 is within them. Their behaviour is instinctive. But the present point is the
 discriminating quality of the sense of hearing; and that is corroborated by
 the singing of birds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id=
 "Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> It is emotional art, expressing feelings in
 the medium of sound. On the part of the females, who are supposed to listen,
 it betokens a cultivated ear.</p>

   <p class="wide">Many broken shells are often found around the anvil.</p>
  </div>
 </div>

 <p>As to the other senses, touch is not highly developed except about the
 bill, where it reaches a climax in birds like the wood-cock, which probe for
 unseen earthworms in the soft soil. Taste seems to be poorly developed, for
 most birds bolt their food, but there is sometimes an emphatic rejection of
 unpalatable things, like toads and caterpillars. Of smell in birds little is
 known, but it has been proved to be present in certain cases, e.g. in some
 nocturnal birds of prey. It seems certain that it is by sight, not by smell,
 that the eagles gather to the carcass; but perhaps there is more smell in
 birds than they are usually credited with. One would like to experiment with
 the oil from the preen gland of birds to see whether the scent of this does
 not help in the recognition of kin by kin at night or amid the darkness of
 the forest. There may be other senses in birds, such as a sense of
 temperature and a sense of balance; but no success has attended the attempts
 made to demonstrate a magnetic sense, which has been impatiently postulated
 by students of bird migration in order to &quot;explain&quot; how the birds
 find their way. The big fact is that in birds there are two widely open
 gateways of knowledge, the sense of sight and the sense of hearing.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Instinctive Aptitudes</h4>

 <p>Many a young water-bird, such as a coot, swims right away when it is
 tumbled into water for the first time. So chicks peck without any learning or
 teaching, very young ducklings catch small moths that flit by, and young
 plovers lie low when the danger-signal sounds. But birds seem strangely
 limited as regards many of these instinctive capacities&mdash;limited when
 compared with the &quot;little-brained&quot; ants and bees, which have from
 the first such a rich repertory of ready-made cleverness. The limitation in
 birds is of great interest, for it means that intelligence is
 coming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg
 222]</a></span> to its own and is going to take up the reins at many corners
 of the daily round. Professor Lloyd Morgan observed that his chickens
 incubated in the laboratory had no instinctive awareness of the significance
 of their mother&#39;s cluck when she was brought outside the door. Although
 thirsty and willing to drink from a moistened finger-tip, they did not
 instinctively recognize water, even when they walked through a saucerful.
 Only when they happened to peck their toes as they stood in the water did
 they appreciate water as the stuff they wanted, and raise their bills up to
 the sky. Once or twice they actually stuffed their crops with
 &quot;worms&quot; of red worsted!</p>

 <p>Instinctive aptitudes, then, the young birds have, but these are more
 limited than in ants, bees, and wasps; and the reason is to be found in the
 fact that the brain is now evolving on the tack of what Sir Ray Lankester has
 called &quot;educability.&quot; Young birds <i>learn</i> with prodigious
 rapidity; the emancipation of the mind from the tyranny of hereditary
 obligations has begun. Young birds make mistakes, like the red worsted
 mistake, but they do not make the same mistakes often. They are able to
 profit by experience in a very rapid way. We do not mean that creatures of
 the little-brain type, like ants, bees, and wasps, are unable to profit by
 experience or are without intelligence. There are no such hard-and-fast
 lines. We mean that in the ordinary life of insects the enregistered
 instinctive capacities are on the whole sufficient for the occasion, and that
 intelligent educability is very slightly developed. Nor do we mean that birds
 are quite emancipated from the tyranny of engrained instinctive obligations,
 and can always &quot;ring up&quot; intelligence in a way that is impossible
 for the stereotyped bee. The sight of a pigeon brooding on an empty nest,
 while her two eggs lie disregarded only a couple of inches away, is enough to
 show that along certain lines birds may find it impossible to get free from
 the trammels of instinct. The peculiar interest of birds is that they have
 many instincts and yet a notable power of learning intelligently.<span class=

 <h4 class="sect">Intelligence co-operating with Instinct</h4>

 <p>Professor Lloyd Morgan was foster-parent to two moorhens which grew up in
 isolation from their kindred. They swam instinctively, but they would not
 dive, neither in a large bath nor in a current. But it happened one day when
 one of these moorhens was swimming in a pool on a Yorkshire stream, that a
 puppy came barking down the bank and made an awkward feint towards the young
 bird. In a moment the moorhen dived, disappeared from view, and soon
 partially reappeared, his head just peeping above the water beneath the
 overhanging bank. This was the first time the bird had dived, and the
 performance was absolutely true to type.</p>

 <p>There can be little doubt as to the meaning of this observation. The
 moorhen has an hereditary or instinctive capacity for swimming and diving,
 but the latter is not so easily called into activity as the former. The
 particular moorhen in question had enjoyed about two months of swimming
 experience, which probably counted for something, but in the course of that
 experience nothing had pulled the trigger of the diving capacity. On an
 eventful day the young moorhen saw and heard the dog; it was emotionally
 excited; it probably did to some extent intelligently appreciate a novel and
 meaningful situation. Intelligence cooperated with instinct, and the bird
 dived appropriately.</p>

 <p>Birds have inborn predispositions to certain effective ways of pecking,
 scratching, swimming, diving, flying, crouching, lying low, nest-building,
 and so on; but they are marked off from the much more purely instinctive ants
 and bees by the extent to which individual &quot;nurture&quot; seems to
 mingle with the inherited &quot;nature.&quot; The two together result in the
 fine product which we call the bird&#39;s behaviour. After Lloyd Morgan&#39;s
 chicks had tried a few conspicuous and unpalatable caterpillars, they had no
 use for any more. They learned in their early days with prodigious rapidity,
 illustrating the deep difference between the &quot;big-brain&quot; type,
 relatively poor in its endowment of instinctive<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> capacities, but eminently
 &quot;educable,&quot; and the &quot;little-brain&quot; type, say, of ants and
 bees, richly endowed with instinctive capacities, but very far from being
 quick or glad to learn. We owe it to Sir Ray Lankester to have made it clear
 that these two types of brain are, as it were, on different tacks of
 evolution, and should not be directly pitted against one another. The
 &quot;little-brain&quot; type makes for a climax in the ant, where
 instinctive behaviour reaches a high degree of perfection; the
 &quot;big-brain&quot; type reaches its climax in horse and dog, in elephant
 and monkey. The particular interest that attaches to the behaviour of birds
 is in the combination of a good deal of instinct with a great deal of
 intelligent learning. This is well illustrated when birds make a nest out of
 new materials or in some quite novel situation. It is clearly seen when birds
 turn to some new kind of food, like the Kea parrot, which attacks the sheep
 in New Zealand.</p>

 <p>Some young woodpeckers are quite clever in opening fir cones to get at the
 seeds, and this might be hastily referred to a well-defined hereditary
 capacity. But the facts are that the parents bring their young ones first the
 seeds themselves, then partly opened cones, and then intact ones. There is an
 educative process, and so it is in scores of cases.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Using their Wits</h4>

 <p>When the Greek eagle lifts the Greek tortoise in its talons, and lets it
 fall from a height so that the strong carapace is broken and the flesh
 exposed, it is making intelligent use of an expedient. Whether it discovered
 the expedient by experimenting, as is possible, or by chance, as is more
 likely, it uses it intelligently. In the same way herring-gulls lift
 sea-urchins and clams in their bills, and let them fall on the rocks so that
 the shells are broken. In the same way rooks deal with freshwater
 mussels.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Thrush&#39;s Anvil</h4>

 <p>A very instructive case is the behaviour of the song-thrush when it takes
 a wood-snail in its beak and hammers it against a<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> stone, its
 so-called anvil. To a young thrush, which she had brought up by hand, Miss
 Frances Pitt offered some wood-snails, but it took no interest in them until
 one put out its head and began to move about. The bird then pecked at the
 snail&#39;s horns, but was evidently puzzled when the creature retreated
 within the shelter of the shell. This happened over and over again, the
 thrush&#39;s inquisitive interest increasing day by day. It pecked at the
 shell and even picked it up by the lip, but no real progress was made till
 the sixth day, when the thrush seized the snail and beat it on the ground as
 it would a big worm. On the same day it picked up a shell and knocked it
 repeatedly against a stone, trying first one snail and then another. After
 fifteen minutes&#39; hard work, the thrush managed to break one, and after
 that it was all easy. A certain predisposition to beat things on the ground
 was doubtless present, but the experiment showed that the use of an anvil
 could be arrived at by an untutored bird. After prolonged trying it found out
 how to deal with a difficult situation. It may be said that in more natural
 conditions this might be picked up by imitation, but while this is quite
 possible, it is useful to notice that experiments with animals lead us to
 doubt whether imitation counts for nearly so much as used to be believed.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 6</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Mind of the Mammal</h4>

 <p>When we watch a collie at a sheep-driving competition, or an elephant
 helping the forester, or a horse shunting waggons at a railway siding, we are
 apt to be too generous to the mammal mind. For in the cases we have just
 mentioned, part of man&#39;s mind has, so to speak, got into the
 animal&#39;s. On the other hand, when we study rabbits and guinea-pigs, we
 are apt to be too stingy, for these rodents are under the average of mammals,
 and those that live in domestication illustrate the stupefying effect of a
 too sheltered life. The same applies to domesticated sheep contrasted with
 wild sheep, or even with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id=
 "Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> their own lambs. If we are to form a sound
 judgment on the intelligence of mammals we must not attend too much to those
 that have profited by man&#39;s training, nor to those whose mental life has
 been dulled by domestication.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Instinctive Aptitudes</h4>

 <p>What is to be said of the behaviour of beavers who gnaw the base of a tree
 with their chisel-edged teeth till only a narrow core is left&mdash;to snap
 in the first gale, bringing the useful branches down to the ground? What is
 to be said of the harvest-mouse constructing its nest, or of the squirrel
 making cache after cache of nuts? These and many similar pieces of behaviour
 are fundamentally instinctive, due to inborn predispositions of nerve-cells
 and muscle-cells. But in mammals they seem to be often attended by a certain
 amount of intelligent attention, saving the creature from the tyranny of
 routine so marked in the ways of ants and bees.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Sheer Dexterity</h4>

 <p>Besides instinctive aptitudes, which are exhibited in almost equal
 perfection by all the members of the same species, there are acquired
 dexterities which depend on individual opportunities. They are also marked by
 being outside and beyond ordinary routine&mdash;not that any rigorous
 boundary line can be drawn. We read that at Mathura on the Jumna doles of
 food are provided by the piety of pilgrims for the sacred river-tortoises,
 which are so crowded when there is food going that their smooth carapaces
 form a more or less continuous raft across the river. On that unsteady
 slippery bridge the Langur monkeys (<i>Semnopithecus entellus</i>) venture
 out and in spite of vicious snaps secure a share of the booty. This picture
 of the monkeys securing a footing on the moving mass of turtle-backs is
 almost a diagram of sheer dexterity. It illustrates the spirit of adventure,
 the will to experiment, which is, we believe, the main motive-force in new
 departures in behaviour.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Power of Association</h4>

 <p>A bull-terrier called Jasper, studied by Prof. J. B. Watson, showed great
 power of associating certain words with certain actions. From a position
 invisible to the dog the owner would give certain commands, such as &quot;Go
 into the next room and bring me a paper lying on the floor.&quot; Jasper did
 this at once, and a score of similar things.</p>

 <p>Lord Avebury&#39;s dog Van was accustomed to go to a box containing a
 small number of printed cards and select the card TEA or OUT, as the occasion
 suggested. It had established an association between certain black marks on a
 white background and the gratification of certain desires. It is probable
 that some of the extraordinary things horses and dogs have been known to do
 in the way of stamping a certain number of times in supposed indication of an
 answer to an arithmetical question (in the case of horses), or of the name of
 an object drawn (in the case of dogs), are dependent on clever associations
 established by the teacher between minute signs and a number of stampings.
 What is certain is that mammals have in varying degrees a strong power of
 establishing associations. There is often some delicacy in the association
 established. Everyone knows of cases where a dog, a cat, or a horse will
 remain quite uninterested, to all appearance, in its owner&#39;s movements
 until some little detail, such as taking a key from its peg, pulls the
 trigger. Now the importance of this in the wild life of the fox or the hare,
 the otter or the squirrel, is obviously that the young animals learn to
 associate certain sounds in their environment with definite possibilities.
 They have to learn an alphabet of woodcraft, the letters of which are chiefly
 sounds and scents.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Dancing Mouse as a Pupil</h4>

 <p>The dancing or waltzing mouse is a Japanese variety with many
 peculiarities, such as having only one of the three semicircular canals of
 the ear well developed. It has a strong tendency<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> to waltz round
 and round in circles without sufficient cause and to trip sideways towards
 its dormitory instead of proceeding in the orthodox head-on fashion. But this
 freak is a very educable creature, as Professor Yerkes has shown. In a
 careful way he confronted his mouse-pupil with alternative pathways marked by
 different degrees of illumination, or by different colours. If the mouse
 chose compartment A, it found a clear passage direct to its nest; if it chose
 compartment B, it was punished by a mild electric shock and it had to take a
 roundabout road home. Needless to say, the A compartment was sometimes to the
 right hand, sometimes to the left, else mere position would have been a
 guide. The experiments showed that the dancing mice learn to discriminate the
 right path from the wrong, and similar results have been got from other
 mammals, such as rats and squirrels. There is no proof of learning by ideas,
 but there is proof of learning by experience. And the same must be true in
 wild life.</p>

 <p>Many mammals, such as cats and rats, learn how to manipulate puzzle-boxes
 and how to get at the treasure at the heart of a Hampton Court maze. Some of
 the puzzle-boxes, with a reward of food inside, are quite difficult, for the
 various bolts and bars have to be dealt with in a particular order, and yet
 many mammals master the problem. What is plain is that they gradually
 eliminate useless movements, that they make fewer and fewer mistakes, that
 they eventually succeed, and that they register the solution within
 themselves so that it remains with them for a time. It looks a little like
 the behaviour of a man who learns a game of skill without thinking. It is a
 learning by experience, not by ideas or reflection. Thus it is very difficult
 to suppose that a rat or a cat could form any idea or even picture of the
 Hampton Court maze&mdash;which they nevertheless master.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Learning Tricks</h4>

 <p>Given sufficient inducement many of the cleverer mammals will learn to do
 very sensible things, and no one is wise enough to<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> say that they
 never understand what they are doing. Yet it is certain that trained animals
 often exhibit pieces of behaviour which are not nearly so clever as they
 look. The elephant at the Belle Vue Gardens in Manchester used to collect
 pennies from benevolent visitors. When it got a penny in its trunk it put it
 in the slot of an automatic machine which delivered up a biscuit. When a
 visitor gave the elephant a halfpenny it used to throw it back with disgust.
 At first sight this seemed almost wise, and there was no doubt some
 intelligent appreciation of the situation. But it was largely a matter of
 habituation, the outcome of careful and prolonged training. The elephant was
 laboriously taught to put the penny in the slot and to discriminate between
 the useful pennies and the useless halfpennies. It was not nearly so clever
 as it looked.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Using their Wits</h4>

 <p>In the beautiful Zoological Park in Edinburgh the Polar Bear was wont to
 sit on a rocky peninsula of a water-filled quarry. The visitors threw in
 buns, some of which floated on the surface. It was often easy for the Polar
 Bear to collect half a dozen by plunging into the pool. But it had discovered
 a more interesting way. At the edge of the peninsula it scooped the water
 gently with its huge paw and made a current which brought the buns ashore.
 This was a simple piece of behaviour, but it has the smack of
 intelligence&mdash;of putting two and two together in a novel way. It
 suggests the power of making what is called a &quot;perceptual
 inference.&quot;</p>

 <p>On the occasion of a great flood in a meadow it was observed that a number
 of mares brought their foals to the top of a knoll, and stood round about
 them protecting them against the rising water. A dog has been known to show
 what was at any rate a plastic appreciation of a varying situation in
 swimming across a tidal river. It changed its starting-point, they say,
 according to the flow or ebb of the tide. Arctic foxes and some other
 wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg
 230]</a></span> mammals show great cleverness in dealing with traps, and the
 manipulative intelligence of elephants is worthy of all our admiration.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 7</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Why is there not more Intelligence?</h4>

 <p>When we allow for dexterity and power of association, when we recognise a
 certain amount of instinctive capacity and a capacity for profiting by
 experience in an intelligent way, we must admit a certain degree of
 disappointment when we take a survey of the behaviour of mammals, especially
 of those with very fine brains, from which we should naturally expect great
 things. Why is there not more frequent exhibition of intelligence in the
 stricter sense?</p>

 <p>The answer is that most mammals have become in the course of time very
 well adapted to the ordinary conditions of their life, and tend to leave well
 alone. They have got their repertory of efficient answers to the ordinary
 questions of everyday life, and why should they experiment? In the course of
 the struggle for existence what has been established is efficiency in normal
 circumstances, and therefore even the higher animals tend to be no cleverer
 than is necessary. So while many mammals are extraordinarily efficient, they
 tend to be a little dull. Their mental equipment is adequate for the everyday
 conditions of their life, but it is not on sufficiently generous lines to
 admit of, let us say, an interest in Nature or adventurous experiment.
 Mammals always tend to &quot;play for safety.&quot;</p>

 <p>We hasten, however, to insert here some very interesting saving
 clauses.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Experimentation in Play</h4>

 <p>A glimpse of what mammals are capable of, were it necessary, may be
 obtained by watching those that are playful, such as lambs and kids, foals
 and calves, young foxes and others. For<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> these young creatures let
 themselves go irresponsibly, they are still unstereotyped, they test what
 they and their fellows can do. The experimental character of much of animal
 play is very marked.</p>

 <p>It is now recognised by biologists that play among animals is the young
 form of work, and that the playing period, often so conspicuous, is vitally
 important as an apprenticeship to the serious business of life and as an
 opportunity for learning the alphabet of Nature. But the playing period is
 much more; it is one of the few opportunities animals have of making
 experiments without too serious responsibilities. Play is Nature&#39;s device
 for allowing elbow-room for new departures (behaviour-variations) which may
 form part of the raw materials of progress. Play, we repeat, gives us a
 glimpse of the possibilities of the mammal mind.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Other Glimpses of Intelligence</h4>

 <p>A squirrel is just as clever as it needs to be and no more; and of some
 vanishing mammals, like the beaver, not even this can be said. Humdrum
 non-plastic efficiency is apt to mean stagnation. Now we have just seen that
 in the play of young mammals there is an indication of unexhausted
 possibilities, and we get the same impression when we think of three other
 facts. (<i>a</i>) In those mammals, like dog and horse, which have entered
 into active cooperative relations with man, we see that the mind of the
 mammal is capable of much more than the average would lead us to think. When
 man&#39;s sheltering is too complete and the domesticated creature is passive
 in his grip, the intelligence deteriorates. (<i>b</i>) When we study mammals,
 like the otter, which live a versatile life in a very complex and difficult
 environment, we get an inspiriting picture of the play of wits. (<i>c</i>)
 Thirdly, when we pass to monkeys, where the fore-limb has become a free hand,
 where the brain shows a relatively great improvement, where &quot;words&quot;
 are much used, we cannot fail to recognise the emergence of
 something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg
 232]</a></span> new&mdash;a restless inquisitiveness, a desire to investigate
 the world, an unsatisfied tendency to experiment. We are approaching the Dawn
 of Reason.</p>

 <h3>THE MIND OF MONKEYS</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 8</h3>

 <p>There is a long gamut between the bushy-tailed, almost squirrel-like
 marmosets and the big-brained chimpanzee. There is great variety of
 attainment at different levels in the Simian tribe.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Keen Senses</h4>

 <p>To begin at the beginning, it is certain that monkeys have a first-class
 sensory equipment, especially as regards sight, hearing, and touch. The axes
 of the two eyes are directed forwards as in man, and a large section of the
 field of vision is common to both eyes. In other words, monkeys have a more
 complete stereoscopic vision than the rest of the mammals enjoy. They look
 more and smell less. They can distinguish different colours, apart from
 different degrees of brightness in the coloured objects. They are quick to
 discriminate differences in the shapes of things, e.g. boxes similar in size
 but different in shape, for if the prize is always put in a box of the same
 shape they soon learn (by association) to select the profitable one. They
 learn to discriminate cards with short words or with signs printed on them,
 coming down when the &quot;Yes&quot; card is shown, remaining on their perch
 when the card says &quot;No.&quot; Bred to a forest life where alertness is a
 life-or-death quality, they are quick to respond to a sudden movement or to
 pick out some new feature in their surroundings. And what is true of vision
 holds also for hearing.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Power of Manipulation</h4>

 <p>Another quality which separates monkeys very markedly from ordinary
 mammals is their manipulative expertness, the co-ordination<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> of hand and
 eye. This great gift follows from the fact that among monkeys the fore-leg
 has been emancipated. It has ceased to be indispensable as an organ of
 support; it has become a climbing, grasping, lifting, handling organ. The
 fore-limb has become a free hand, and everyone who knows monkeys at all is
 aware of the zest with which they use their tool. They enjoy pulling things
 to pieces&mdash;a kind of dissection&mdash;or screwing the handle off a brush
 and screwing it on again.</p>

   <p class="wide">In his famous book on <i>The Expression of the Emotions in
   Man and Animals</i> (1872) Charles Darwin showed that many forms of facial
   expression familiar in man have their counterparts in apes and other
   mammals. He also showed how important the movements of expression are as
   means of communication between mother and offspring, mate and mate, kith
   and kin.</p>

   <p class="wide">The anthropoid apes show notable differences of temperament
   as the photographs show. The chimpanzee is lively, cheerful, and educable.
   The orang is also mild of temper, but often and naturally appears
   melancholy in captivity. This is not suggested, however, by our photograph
   of the adult. Both chimpanzee and orang are markedly contrasted with the
   fierce and gloomy gorilla.</p>
  </div>
 </div>

 <h4 class="sect">Activity for Activity&#39;s Sake</h4>

 <p>Professor Thorndike hits the nail on the head when he lays stress on the
 intensity of activity in monkeys&mdash;activity both of body and mind. They
 are pent-up reservoirs of energy, which almost any influence will tap. Watch
 a cat or a dog, Professor Thorndike says; it does comparatively few things
 and is content for long periods to do nothing. It will be splendidly active
 in response to some stimulus such as food or a friend or a fight, but if
 nothing appeals to its special make-up, which is very utilitarian in its
 interests, it will do nothing. &quot;Watch a monkey and you cannot enumerate
 the things he does, cannot discover the stimuli to which he reacts, cannot
 conceive the <i>raison d&#39;etre</i> of his pursuits. Everything appeals to
 him. He likes to be active for the sake of activity.&quot;</p>

 <p>This applies to mental activity as well, and the quality is one of
 extraordinary interest, for it shows the experimenting mood at a higher turn
 of the spiral than in any other creature, save man. It points forward to the
 scientific spirit. We cannot, indeed, believe in the sudden beginning of any
 quality, and we recall the experimenting of playing mammals, such as kids and
 kittens, or of inquisitive adults like Kipling&#39;s mongoose,
 Riki-Tiki-Tavi, which made it his business in life to find out about things.
 But in monkeys the habit of restless experimenting rises to a higher pitch.
 They appear to be curious about the world. The psychologist whom we have
 quoted tells of a monkey which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id=
 "Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> happened to hit a projecting wire so as to
 make it vibrate. He went on repeating the performance hundreds of times
 during the next few days. Of course, he got nothing out of it, save fun, but
 it was grist to his mental mill. &quot;The fact of mental life is to monkeys
 it own reward.&quot; The monkey&#39;s brain is &quot;tender all over,
 functioning throughout, set off in action by anything and
 everything.&quot;</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Sheer Quickness</h4>

 <p>Correlated with the quality of restless inquisitiveness and delight in
 activity for its own sake there is the quality of quickness. We mean not
 merely the locomotor agility that marks most monkeys, but quickness of
 perception and plan. It is the sort of quality that life among the branches
 will engender, where it is so often a case of neck or nothing. It is the
 quality which we describe as being on the spot, though the phrase has slipped
 from its original moorings. Speaking of his Bonnet Monkey, an Indian macaque,
 second cousin to the kind that lives on the Rock of Gibraltar, Professor S.
 J. Holmes writes: &quot;For keenness of perception, rapidity of action,
 facility in forming good practical judgments about ways and means of escaping
 pursuit and of attaining various other ends, Lizzie had few rivals in the
 animal world.... Her perceptions and decisions were so much more rapid than
 my own that she would frequently transfer her attention, decide upon a line
 of action, and carry it into effect before I was aware of what she was about.
 Until I came to guard against her nimble and unexpected man&oelig;uvres, she
 succeeded in getting possession of many apples and peanuts which I had not
 intended to give her except upon the successful performance of some
 task.&quot;</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Quick to Learn</h4>

 <p>Quite fundamental to any understanding of animal behaviour is the
 distinction so clearly drawn by Sir Ray Lankester between the
 &quot;little-brain&quot; type, rich in inborn or instinctive
 capacities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg
 235]</a></span> but relatively slow to learn, and the &quot;big-brain&quot;
 type, with a relatively poor endowment of specialised instincts, but with
 great educability. The &quot;little-brain&quot; type finds its climax in ants
 and bees; the &quot;big-brain&quot; type in horses and dogs, elephants and
 monkeys. And of all animals monkeys are the quickest to learn, if we use the
 word &quot;learn&quot; to mean the formation of useful associations between
 this and that, between a given sense-presentation and a particular piece of
 behaviour.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Case of Sally</h4>

 <p>Some of us remember Sally, the chimpanzee at the &quot;Zoo&quot; with
 which Dr. Romanes used to experiment. She was taught to give her teacher the
 number of straws he asked for, and she soon learned to do so up to five. If
 she handed a number not asked for, her offer was refused; if she gave the
 proper number, she got a piece of fruit. If she was asked for five straws,
 she picked them up individually and placed them in her mouth, and when she
 had gathered five she presented them together in her hand. Attempts to teach
 her to give six to ten straws were not very successful. For Sally &quot;above
 six&quot; meant &quot;many,&quot; and besides, her limits of patience were
 probably less than her range of computation. This was hinted at by the highly
 interesting circumstance that when dealing with numbers above five she very
 frequently doubled over a straw so as to make it present two ends and thus
 appear as two straws. The doubling of the straw looked like an intelligent
 device to save time, and it was persistently resorted to in spite of the fact
 that her teacher always refused to accept a doubled straw as equivalent to
 two straws. Here we get a glimpse of something beyond the mere association of
 a sound&mdash;&quot;Five&quot;&mdash;and that number of straws.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Case of Lizzie</h4>

 <p>The front of the cage in which Professor Holmes kept Lizzie was made of
 vertical bars which allowed her to reach out with her arm. On a board with an
 upright nail as handle, there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id=
 "Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> placed an apple&mdash;out of Lizzie&#39;s
 reach. She reached immediately for the nail, pulled the board in and got the
 apple. &quot;There was no employment of the method of trial and error; there
 was direct appropriate action following the perception of her relation to
 board, nail, and apple.&quot; Of course her ancestors may have been adepts at
 drawing a fruit-laden branch within their reach, but the simple experiment
 was very instructive. All the more instructive because in many other cases
 the experiments indicate a gradual sifting out of useless movements and an
 eventful retention of the one that pays. When Lizzie was given a vaseline
 bottle containing a peanut and closed with a cork, she at once pulled the
 cork out with her teeth, obeying the instinct to bite at new objects, but she
 never learned to turn the bottle upside down and let the nut drop out. She
 often got the nut, and after some education she got it more quickly than she
 did at first, but there was no indication that she ever perceived the fit and
 proper way of getting what she wanted. &quot;In the course of her intent
 efforts her mind seemed so absorbed with the object of desire that it was
 never focussed on the means of attaining that object. There was no
 deliberation, and no discrimination between the important and the unimportant
 elements in her behaviour. The gradually increasing facility of her
 performances depended on the apparently unconscious elimination of useless
 movements.&quot; This may be called learning, but it is learning at a very
 low level; it is far from learning by ideas; it is hardly even learning by
 experiment; it is not more than learning by experience, it is not more than
 fumbling at learning!</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Trial and Error</h4>

 <p>A higher note is struck in the behaviour of some more highly endowed
 monkeys. In many experiments, chiefly in the way of getting into boxes
 difficult to open, there is evidence (1) of attentive persistent experiment
 (2) of the rapid elimination of ineffective movements, and (3) of remembering
 the solution when it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id=
 "Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> was discovered. Kinnaman taught two macaques
 the Hampton Court Maze, a feat which probably means a memory of movements,
 and we get an interesting glimpse in his observation that they began to smack
 their lips audibly when they reached the latter part of their course, and
 began to feel, dare one say, &quot;We are right this time.&quot;</p>

 <p>In getting into &quot;puzzle-boxes&quot; and into
 &quot;combination-boxes&quot; (where the barriers must be overcome in a
 definite order), monkeys learn by the trial and error method much more
 quickly than cats and dogs do, and a very suggestive fact emphasized by
 Professor Thorndike is &quot;a process of sudden acquisition by a rapid,
 often apparently instantaneous abandonment of the unsuccessful movements and
 selection of the appropriate one, which rivals in suddenness the selections
 made by human beings in similar performances.&quot; A higher note still was
 sounded by one of Thorndike&#39;s monkeys which opened a puzzle-box at once,
 eight months after his previous experience with it. For here was some sort of
 registration of a solution.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Imitation</h4>

 <p>Two chimpanzees in the Dublin Zoo were often to be seen washing the two
 shelves of their cupboard and &quot;wringing&quot; the wet cloth in the
 approved fashion. It was like a caricature of a washerwoman, and someone
 said, &quot;What mimics they are!&quot; Now we do not know whether that was
 or was not the case with the chimpanzees, but the majority of the experiments
 that have been made do not lead us to attach to imitation so much importance
 as is usually given to it by the popular interpreter. There are instances
 where a monkey that had given up a puzzle in despair returned to it when it
 had seen its neighbour succeed, but most of the experiments suggested that
 the creature has to find out for itself. Even with such a simple problem as
 drawing food near with a stick, it often seems of little use to show the
 monkey how it is done. Placing a bit of food outside his
 monkey&#39;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg
 238]</a></span> cage, Professor Holmes &quot;poked it about with the stick so
 as to give her a suggestion of how the stick might be employed to move the
 food within reach, but although the act was repeated many times Lizzie never
 showed the least inclination to use the stick to her advantage.&quot; Perhaps
 the idea of a &quot;tool&quot; is beyond the Bonnet Monkey, yet here again we
 must be cautious, for Professor L. T. Hobhouse had a monkey of the same
 macaque genus which learned in the course of time to use a crooked stick with
 great effect.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Case of Peter</h4>

 <p>Perhaps the cleverest monkey as yet studied was a performing chimpanzee
 called Peter, which has been generally described by Dr. Lightner Witmer.
 Peter could skate and cycle, thread needles and untie knots, smoke a
 cigarette and string beads, screw in nails and unlock locks. But what Peter
 was thinking about all the time it was hard to guess, and there is very
 little evidence to suggest that his rapid power of putting two and two
 together ever rose above a sort of concrete mental experimenting, which Dr.
 Romanes used to call perceptual inference. Without supposing that there are
 hard-and-fast boundary lines, we cannot avoid the general conclusion that,
 while monkeys are often intelligent, they seldom, if ever, show even hints of
 reason, i.e. of working or playing with general ideas. That remains Man&#39;s
 prerogative.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Bustle of the Mind</h4>

 <p>In mammals like otters, foxes, stoats, hares, and elephants, what a
 complex of tides and currents there must be in the brain-mind! We may think
 of a stream with currents at different levels. Lowest there are the <i>basal
 appetites</i> of hunger and sex, often with eddies rising to the surface.
 Then there are the <i>primary emotions</i>, such as fear of hereditary
 enemies and maternal affection for offspring. Above these are <i>instinctive
 aptitudes</i>, inborn powers of doing clever things without having to
 learn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg
 239]</a></span> how. But in mammals these are often expressed along with, or
 as it were through, the controlled life of <i>intelligent activity</i>, where
 there is more clear-cut perceptual influence.</p>

  </div>
 </div>

 <p>Higher still are the records or memories of individual experience and the
 registration of individual habits, while on the surface is the instreaming
 multitude of messages from the outside world, like raindrops and hailstones
 on the stream, some of them penetrating deeply, being, as we say, full of
 meaning. The mind of the higher animal is in some respects like a child&#39;s
 mind, in having little in the way of clear-cut ideas, in showing no reason in
 the strict sense, and in its extraordinary educability, but it differs from
 the child&#39;s mind entirely in the sure effectiveness of a certain
 repertory of responses. It is efficient to a degree.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">&quot;Until at last arose the Man.&quot;</h4>

 <p>Man&#39;s brain is more complicated than that of the higher
 apes&mdash;gorilla, orang, and chimpanzee&mdash;and it is relatively larger.
 But the improvements in structure do not seem in themselves sufficient to
 account for man&#39;s great advance in intelligence. The rill of inner life
 has become a swift stream, sometimes a rushing torrent. Besides perceptual
 inference or <i>Intelligence</i>&mdash;a sort of picture-logic, which some
 animals likewise have&mdash;there is conceptual inference&mdash;or
 <i>Reason</i>&mdash;an internal experimenting with general ideas. Even the
 cleverest animals, it would seem, do not get much beyond playing with
 &quot;particulars&quot;; man plays an internal game of chess with
 &quot;universals.&quot; Intelligent behaviour may go a long way with mental
 images; rational conduct demands general ideas. It may be, however, that
 &quot;percepts&quot; and &quot;concepts&quot; differ rather in degree than in
 kind, and that the passage from one to the other meant a higher power of
 forming associations. A clever dog has probably a generalised percept of man,
 as distinguished from a memory-image of the particular men it has known, but
 man alone has the concept Man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id=
 "Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> or Mankind, or Humanity. Experimenting with
 concepts or general ideas is what we call Reason.</p>

 <p>Here, of course, we get into deep waters, and perhaps it is wisest not to
 attempt too much. So we shall content ourselves here with pointing out that
 Man&#39;s advance in intelligence and from intelligence to reason is closely
 wrapped up with his power of speech. What animals began&mdash;a small
 vocabulary&mdash;he has carried to high perfection. But what is distinctive
 is not the vocabulary so much as the habit of making sentences, of expressing
 judgments in a way which admitted of communication between mind and mind. The
 multiplication of words meant much, the use of words as symbols of general
 ideas meant even more, for it meant the possibility of playing the internal
 game of thinking; but perhaps the most important advance of all was the means
 of comparing notes with neighbours, of corroborating individual experience by
 social intercourse. With words, also, it became easier to enregister outside
 himself the gains of the past. It is not without significance that the Greek
 Logos, which may be translated &quot;the word,&quot; may also be translated
 Mind.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 9</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Looking Backwards</h4>

 <p>When we take a survey of animal behaviour we see a long inclined plane.
 The outer world provokes simple creatures to answer back; simple creatures
 act experimentally on their surroundings. From the beginning this twofold
 process has been going on, receiving stimuli from the environment and acting
 upon the environment, and according to the efficiency of the reactions and
 actions living creatures have been sifted for millions of years. One main
 line of advance has been opening new gateways of knowledge&mdash;the senses,
 which are far more than five in number. The other main line of advance has
 been in most general terms, experimenting or testing, probing and proving,
 trying one key after another till a door is unlocked. There is<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> progress in
 multiplying the gateways of knowledge and making them more discriminating,
 and there is progress in making the modes of experimenting more wide-awake,
 more controlled, and more resolute. But behind both of these is the
 characteristically vital power of enregistering within the organism the
 lessons of the past. In the life of the individual these enregistrations are
 illustrated by memories and habituations and habits; in the life of the race
 they are illustrated by reflex actions and instinctive capacities.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Body and Mind</h4>

 <p>We must not shirk the very difficult question of the relation between the
 bodily and the mental side of behaviour.</p>

 <p>(<i>a</i>) Some great thinkers have taught that the mind is a reality by
 itself which plays upon the instrument of the brain and body. As the
 instrument gets worn and dusty the playing is not so good as it once was, but
 the player is still himself. This theory of the essential independence of the
 mind is a very beautiful one, but those who like it when applied to
 themselves are not always so fond of it when it is applied to other
 intelligent creatures like rooks and elephants. It may be, however, that
 there is a gradual emancipation of the mind which has gone furthest in Man
 and is still progressing.</p>

 <p>(<i>b</i>) Some other thinkers have taught that the inner life of thought
 and feeling is only, as it were, an echo of the really important
 activity&mdash;that of the body and brain. Ideas are just foam-bells on the
 hurrying streams and circling eddies of matter and energy that make up our
 physiological life. To most of us this theory is impossible, because we are
 quite sure that ideas and feelings and purposes, which cannot be translated
 into matter and motion, are the clearest realities in our experience, and
 that they count for good and ill all through our life. They are more than the
 tickings of the clock; they make the wheels go round.<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

 <p>(<i>c</i>) There are others who think that the most scientific position is
 simply to recognise both the bodily and the mental activities as equally
 important, and so closely interwoven that they cannot be separated. Perhaps
 they are just the outer and the inner aspects of one reality&mdash;the life
 of the creature. Perhaps they are like the concave and convex curves of a
 dome, like the two sides of a shield. Perhaps the life of the organism is
 always a unity, at one time appearing more conspicuously as Mind-body, at
 another time as Body-mind. The most important fact is that neither aspect can
 be left out. By no jugglery with words can we get Mind out of Matter and
 Motion. And since we are in ourselves quite sure of our Mind, we are probably
 safe in saying that in the beginning was Mind. This is in accordance with
 Aristotle&#39;s saying that there is nothing in the end which was not also in
 kind present in the beginning&mdash;whatever we mean by beginning.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">In conclusion</h4>

 <p>What has led to the truly wonderful result which we admire in a creature
 like a dog or an otter, a horse or a hare? In general, we may say, just two
 main processes&mdash;(1) testing all things, and (2) holding fast that which
 is good. New departures occur and these are tested for what they are worth.
 Idiosyncrasies crop up and they are sifted. New cards come mysteriously from
 within into the creature&#39;s hand, and they are played&mdash;for better or
 for worse. So by new variations and their sifting, by experimenting and
 enregistering the results, the mind has gradually evolved and will continue
 to evolve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg

 <h2>VIII</h2>

 <h2>FOUNDATIONS OF THE UNIVERSE</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>THE WORLD OF ATOMS</h3>

 <p>Most people have heard of the oriental race which puzzled over the
 foundations of the universe, and decided that it must be supported on the
 back of a giant elephant. But the elephant? They put it on the back of a
 monstrous tortoise, and there they let the matter end. If every animal in
 nature had been called upon, they would have been no nearer a foundation.
 Most ancient peoples, indeed, made no effort to find a foundation. The
 universe was a very compact little structure, mainly composed of the earth
 and the great canopy over the earth which they called the sky. They left it,
 as a whole, floating in nothing. And in this the ancients were wiser than
 they knew. Things do not fall down unless they are pulled down by that
 mysterious force which we call gravitation. The earth, it is true, is pulled
 by the sun, and would fall into it; but the earth escapes this fiery fate by
 circulating at great speed round the sun. The stars pull each other; but it
 has already been explained that they meet this by travelling rapidly in
 gigantic orbits. Yet we do, in a new sense of the word, need foundations of
 the universe. Our mind craves for some explanation of the matter out of which
 the universe is made. For this explanation we turn to modern Physics and
 Chemistry. Both these sciences study, under different aspects, matter and
 energy; and between them they have put together a conception of the
 fundamental nature of things which marks an epoch in the history of human
 thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg
 246]</a></span></p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 1</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Bricks of the Cosmos</h4>

 <p>More than two thousand years ago the first men of science, the Greeks of
 the cities of Asia Minor, speculated on the nature of matter. You can grind a
 piece of stone into dust. You can divide a spoonful of water into as many
 drops as you like. Apparently you can go on dividing as long as you have got
 apparatus fine enough for the work. But there must be a limit, these Greeks
 said, and so they supposed that all matter was ultimately composed of minute
 particles which were indivisible. That is the meaning of the Greek word
 &quot;atom.&quot;</p>

 <p>Like so many other ideas of these brilliant early Greek thinkers, the atom
 was a sound conception. We know to-day that matter is composed of atoms. But
 science was then so young that the way in which the Greeks applied the idea
 was not very profound. A liquid or a gas, they said, consisted of round,
 smooth atoms, which would not cling together. Then there were atoms with
 rough surfaces, &quot;hooky&quot; surfaces, and these stuck together and
 formed solids. The atoms of iron or marble, for instance, were so very hooky
 that, once they got together, a strong man could not tear them apart. The
 Greeks thought that the explanation of the universe was that an infinite
 number of these atoms had been moving and mixing in an infinite space during
 an infinite time, and had at last hit by chance on the particular combination
 which is our universe.</p>

 <p>This was too simple and superficial. The idea of atoms was cast aside,
 only to be advanced again in various ways. It was the famous Manchester
 chemist, John Dalton, who restored it in the early years of the nineteenth
 century. He first definitely formulated the atomic theory as a scientific
 hypothesis. The whole physical and chemical science of that century was now
 based upon the atom, and it is quite a mistake to suppose that recent
 discoveries have discredited &quot;atomism.&quot; An atom is the smallest
 particle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg
 247]</a></span> of a chemical element. No one has ever seen an atom. Even the
 wonderful new microscope which has just been invented cannot possibly show us
 particles of matter which are a million times smaller than the breadth of a
 hair; for that is the size of atoms. We can weigh them and measure them,
 though they are invisible, and we know that all matter is composed of them.
 It is a new discovery that atoms are not indivisible. They consist themselves
 of still smaller particles, as we shall see. But the atoms exist all the
 same, and we may still say that they are the bricks of which the material
 universe is built.</p>

 <p>But if we had some magical glass by means of which we could see into the
 structure of material things, we should not see the atoms put evenly together
 as bricks are in a wall. As a rule, two or more atoms first come together to
 form a larger particle, which we call a &quot;molecule.&quot; Single atoms do
 not, as a rule, exist apart from other atoms; if a molecule is broken up, the
 individual atoms seek to unite with other atoms of another kind or amongst
 themselves. For example, three atoms of oxygen form what we call ozone; two
 atoms of hydrogen uniting with one atom of oxygen form water. It is molecules
 that form the mass of matter; a molecule, as it has been expressed, is a
 little building of which atoms are the bricks.</p>

 <p>In this way we get a useful first view of the material things we handle.
 In a liquid the molecules of the liquid cling together loosely. They remain
 together as a body, but they roll over and away from each other. There is
 &quot;cohesion&quot; between them, but it is less powerful than in a solid.
 Put some water in a kettle over the lighted gas, and presently the tiny
 molecules of water will rush through the spout in a cloud of steam and
 scatter over the kitchen. The heat has broken their bond of association and
 turned the water into something like a gas; though we know that the particles
 will come together again, as they cool, and form once more drops of
 water.</p>

 <p>In a gas the molecules have full individual liberty. They<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> are in a state
 of violent movement, and they form no union with each other. If we want to
 force them to enter into the loose sort of association which molecules have
 in a liquid, we have to slow down their individual movements by applying
 severe cold. That is how a modern man of science liquefies gases. No power
 that we have will liquefy air at its ordinary temperature. In <i>very</i>
 severe cold, on the other hand, the air will spontaneously become liquid.
 Some day, when the fires of the sun have sunk very low, the temperature of
 the earth will be less than -200° C.: that is to say, more than two hundred
 degrees Centigrade below freezing-point. It will sink to the temperature of
 the moon. Our atmosphere will then be an ocean of liquid air, 35 feet deep,
 lying upon the solidly frozen masses of our water-oceans.</p>

 <p>In a solid the molecules cling firmly to each other. We need a force equal
 to twenty-five tons to tear asunder the molecules in a bar of iron an inch
 thick. Yet the structure is not &quot;solid&quot; in the popular sense of the
 word. If you put a piece of solid gold in a little pool of mercury, the gold
 will take in the mercury <i>between</i> its molecules, as if it were porous
 like a sponge. The hardest solid is more like a lattice-work than what we
 usually mean by &quot;solid&quot;; though the molecules are not fixed, like
 the bars of a lattice-work, but are in violent motion; they vibrate about
 equilibrium positions. If we could see right into the heart of a bit of the
 hardest steel, we should see billions of separate molecules, at some distance
 from each other, all moving rapidly to and fro.</p>

 <p>This molecular movement can, in a measure, be made visible. It was noticed
 by a microscopist named Brown that, in a solution containing very fine
 suspended particles, the particles were in constant movement. Under a
 powerful microscope these particles are seen to be violently agitated; they
 are each independently darting hither and thither somewhat like a lot of
 billiard balls on a billiard table, colliding and bounding about in all
 directions. Thousands of times a second these encounters occur, and this
 lively commotion is always going on, this incessant colliding of<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> one molecule
 with another is the normal condition of affairs; not one of them is at rest.
 The reason for this has been worked out, and it is now known that these
 particles move about because they are being incessantly bombarded by the
 molecules of the liquid. The molecules cannot, of course, be seen, but the
 fact of their incessant movement is revealed to the eye by the behaviour of
 the visible suspended particles. This incessant movement in the world of
 molecules is called the Brownian movement, and is a striking proof of the
 reality of molecular motions.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Wonder-World of Atoms</h4>

 <p>The exploration of this wonder-world of atoms and molecules by the
 physicists and chemists of to-day is one of the most impressive triumphs of
 modern science. Quite apart from radium and electrons and other sensational
 discoveries of recent years, the study of ordinary matter is hardly inferior,
 either in interest or audacity, to the work of the astronomer. And there is
 the same foundation in both cases&mdash;marvellous apparatus, and trains of
 mathematical reasoning that would have astonished Euclid or Archimedes.
 Extraordinary, therefore, as are some of the facts and figures we are now
 going to give in connection with the minuteness of atoms and molecules, let
 us bear in mind that we owe them to the most solid and severe processes of
 human thought.</p>

 <p>Yet the principle can in most cases be made so clear that the reader will
 not be asked to take much on trust. It is, for instance, a matter of common
 knowledge that gold is soft enough to be beaten into gold leaf. It is a
 matter of common sense, one hopes, that if you beat a measured cube of gold
 into a leaf six inches square, the mathematician can tell the thickness of
 that leaf without measuring it. As a matter of fact, a single grain of gold
 has been beaten into a leaf seventy-five inches square. Now the mathematician
 can easily find that when a single grain of gold is beaten out to that size,
 the leaf must be 1/367,000 of an inch thick,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> or about a thousand times
 thinner than the paper on which these words are printed; yet the leaf must be
 several molecules thick.</p>

 <p>The finest gold leaf is, in fact, too thick for our purpose, and we turn
 with a new interest to that toy of our boyhood the soap-bubble. If you
 carefully examine one of these delicate films of soapy water, you notice
 certain dark spots or patches on them. These are their thinnest parts, and by
 two quite independent methods&mdash;one using electricity and the other
 light&mdash;we have found that at these spots the bubble is less than the
 three-millionth of an inch thick! But the molecules in the film cling
 together so firmly that they must be at least twenty or thirty deep in the
 thinnest part. A molecule, therefore, must be far less than the
 three-millionth of an inch thick.</p>

 <p>We found next that a film of oil on the surface of water may be even
 thinner than a soap-bubble. Professor Perrin, the great French authority on
 atoms, got films of oil down to the fifty-millionth of an inch in thickness!
 He poured a measured drop of oil upon water. Then he found the exact limits
 of the area of the oil-sheet by blowing upon the water a fine powder which
 spread to the edge of the film and clearly outlined it. The rest is safe and
 simple calculation, as in the case of the beaten grain of gold. Now this film
 of oil must have been at least two molecules deep, so a single molecule of
 oil is considerably less than a hundred-millionth of an inch in diameter.</p>

 <p>Innumerable methods have been tried, and the result is always the same. A
 single grain of indigo, for instance, will colour a ton of water. This
 obviously means that the grain contains billions of molecules which spread
 through the water. A grain of musk will scent a room&mdash;pour molecules
 into every part of it&mdash;for several years, yet not lose one-millionth of
 its mass in a year. There are a hundred ways of showing the minuteness of the
 ultimate particles of matter, and some of these enable us to give definite
 figures. On a careful comparison of the best methods we can say that the
 average molecule of matter is less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251"
 id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> than the 1/125,000,000 of an inch in
 diameter. In a single cubic centimetre of air&mdash;a globule about the size
 of a small marble&mdash;there are thirty million trillion molecules. And
 since the molecule is, as we saw, a group or cluster of atoms, the atom
 itself is smaller. Atoms, for reasons which we shall see later, differ very
 greatly from each other in size and weight. It is enough to say that some of
 them are so small that it would take 400,000,000 of them, in a line, to cover
 an inch of space; and that it takes at least a quintillion atoms of gold to
 weigh a single gramme. Five million atoms of helium could be placed in a line
 across the diameter of a full stop.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Energy of Atoms</h4>

 <p>And this is only the beginning of the wonders that were done with
 &quot;ordinary matter,&quot; quite apart from radium and its revelations, to
 which we will come presently. Most people have heard of &quot;atomic
 energy,&quot; and the extraordinary things that might be accomplished if we
 could harness this energy and turn it to human use. A deeper and more
 wonderful source of this energy has been discovered in the last twenty years,
 but it is well to realise that the atoms themselves have stupendous energy.
 The atoms of matter are vibrating or gyrating with extraordinary vigour. The
 piece of cold iron you hold in your hand, the bit of brick you pick up, or
 the penny you take from your pocket is a colossal reservoir of energy, since
 it consists of trillions of moving atoms. To realise the total energy, of
 course, we should have to witness a transformation such as we do in atoms of
 radio-active elements, about which we shall have something to say
 presently.</p>

 <p>If we put a grain of indigo in a glass of water, or a grain of musk in a
 perfectly still room, we soon realise that molecules travel. Similarly, the
 fact that gases spread until they fill every &quot;empty&quot; available
 space shows definitely that they consist of small particles travelling at
 great speed. The physicist brings his refined methods to bear on these
 things, and he measures the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id=
 "Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> energy and velocity of these infinitely minute
 molecules. He tells us that molecules of oxygen, at the temperature of
 melting ice, travel at the rate of about 500 yards a second&mdash;more than a
 quarter of a mile a second. Molecules of hydrogen travel at four times that
 speed, or three times the speed with which a bullet leaves a rifle. Each
 molecule of the air, which seems so still in the house on a summer&#39;s day,
 is really travelling faster than a rifle bullet does at the beginning of its
 journey. It collides with another molecule every twenty-thousandth of an inch
 of its journey. It is turned from its course 5,000,000,000 times in every
 second by collisions. If we could stop the molecules of hydrogen gas, and
 utilise their energy, as we utilise the energy of steam or the energy of the
 water at Niagara, we should find enough in every gramme of gas (about
 two-thousandths of a pound) to raise a third of a ton to a height of forty
 inches.</p>

 <p>I have used for comparison the speed of a rifle bullet, and in an earlier
 generation people would have thought it impossible even to estimate this. It
 is, of course, easy. We put two screens in the path of the bullet, one near
 the rifle and the other some distance away. We connect them electrically and
 use a fine time-recording machine, and the bullet itself registers the time
 it takes to travel from the first to the second screen.</p>

 <p>Now this is very simple and superficial work in comparison with the system
 of exact and minute measurements which the physicist and chemist use. In one
 of his interesting works Mr. Charles R. Gibson gives a photograph of two
 exactly equal pieces of paper in the opposite pans of a fine balance. A
 single word has been written in pencil on one of these papers, and that
 little scraping of lead has been enough to bring down the scale! The
 spectroscope will detect a quantity of matter four million times smaller even
 than this; and the electroscope is a million times still more sensitive than
 the spectroscope. We have a heat-measuring instrument, the bolometer, which
 makes the best thermometer seem Early Victorian. It records the millionth of
 a degree of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg
 253]</a></span> temperature. It is such instruments, multiplied by the score,
 which enable us to do the fine work recorded in these pages.</p>

   thicknesses of the surface. Part of the light which strikes these thin
   coatings is reflected from the upper surface, but another part of the light
   penetrates the transparent coating and is reflected from the lower surface.
   It is the mixture of these two reflected rays, their
   &quot;interference&quot; as it is called, which produces the colours
   observed. The &quot;black spots&quot; on a soap bubble are the places where
   the soapy film is thinnest. At the black spots the thickness of the bubble
   is about the three-millionth part of an inch. If the whole bubble were as
   thin as this it would be completely invisible.</p>

 <h3>THE DISCOVERY OF X-RAYS AND RADIUM</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Discovery of Sir Wm. Crookes</h4>

 <p>But these wonders of the atom are only a prelude to the more romantic and
 far-reaching discoveries of the new physics&mdash;the wonders of the
 electron. Another and the most important phase of our exploration of the
 material universe opened with the discovery of radium in 1898.</p>

 <p>In the discovery of radio-active elements, a new property of matter was
 discovered. What followed on the discovery of radium and of the X-rays we
 shall see.</p>

 <p>As Sir Ernest Rutherford, one of our greatest authorities, recently said,
 the new physics has dissipated the last doubt about the reality of atoms and
 molecules. The closer examination of matter which we have been able to make
 shows positively that it is composed of atoms. But we must not take the word
 now in its original Greek meaning (an &quot;indivisible&quot; thing). The
 atoms are not indivisible. They can be broken up. They are composed of still
 smaller particles.</p>

 <p>The discovery that the atom was composed of smaller particles was the
 welcome realisation of a dream that had haunted the imagination of the
 nineteenth century. Chemists said that there were about eighty different
 kinds of atoms&mdash;different kinds of matter&mdash;but no one was satisfied
 with the multiplicity. Science is always aiming at simplicity and unity. It
 may be that science has now taken a long step in the direction of explaining
 the fundamental unity of all the matter. The chemist was unable to break up
 these &quot;elements&quot; into something simpler, so he called their atoms
 &quot;indivisible&quot; in that sense. But one man of science after another
 expressed the hope that we would yet discover<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> some fundamental matter of which
 the various atoms were composed&mdash;<i>one primordial substance from which
 all the varying forms of matter have been evolved or built up</i>. Prout
 suggested this at the very beginning of the century, when atoms were
 rediscovered by Dalton. Father Secchi, the famous Jesuit astronomer said that
 all the atoms were probably evolved from ether; and this was a very favoured
 speculation. Sir William Crookes talked of &quot;prothyl&quot; as the
 fundamental substance. Others thought hydrogen was the stuff out of which all
 the other atoms were composed.</p>

 <p>The work which finally resulted in the discovery of radium began with some
 beautiful experiments of Professor (later Sir William) Crookes in the
 eighties.</p>

 <p>It had been noticed in 1869 that a strange colouring was caused when an
 electric charge was sent through a vacuum tube&mdash;the walls of the glass
 tube began to glow with a greenish phosphorescence. A vacuum tube is one from
 which nearly all the air has been pumped, although we can never completely
 empty the tube. Crookes used such ingenious methods that he reduced the gas
 in his tubes until it was twenty million times thinner than the atmosphere.
 He then sent an electric discharge through, and got very remarkable results.
 The negative pole of the electric current (the &quot;cathode&quot;) <i>gave
 off rays which faintly lit the molecules of the thin gas in the tube</i>, and
 caused a pretty fluorescence on the glass walls of the tube. What were these
 Rays? Crookes at first thought they corresponded to a &quot;new or fourth
 state of matter.&quot; Hitherto we had only been familiar with matter in the
 three conditions of solid, liquid, and gaseous.</p>

 <p>Now Crookes really had the great secret under his eyes. But about twenty
 years elapsed before the true nature of these rays was finally and
 independently established by various experiments. The experiments proved
 &quot;that the rays consisted of a stream of negatively charged particles
 travelling with enormous velocities from 10,000 to 100,000 miles a second. In
 addition, it was found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id=
 "Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> that the mass of each particle was exceedingly
 small, about 1/1800 of the mass of a hydrogen atom, the lightest atom known
 to science.&quot; <i>These particles or electrons, as they are now called,
 were being liberated from the atom.</i> The atoms of matter were breaking
 down in Crookes tubes. At that time, however, it was premature to think of
 such a thing, and Crookes preferred to say that the particles of the gas were
 electrified and hurled against the walls of the tube. He said that it was
 ordinary matter in a new state&mdash;&quot;radiant matter.&quot; Another
 distinguished man of science, Lenard, found that, when he fitted a little
 plate of aluminum in the glass wall of the tube, the mysterious rays passed
 through this as if it were a window. They must be waves in the ether, he
 said.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 4</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Discovery of X-rays</h4>

 <p>So the story went on from year to year. We shall see in a moment to what
 it led. Meanwhile the next great step was when, in 1895, Röntgen discovered
 the X-rays, which are now known to everybody. He was following up the work of
 Lenard, and he one day covered a &quot;Crookes tube&quot; with some black
 stuff. To his astonishment a prepared chemical screen which was near the tube
 began to glow. <i>The rays had gone through the black stuff; and on further
 experiment he found that they would go through stone, living flesh, and all
 sorts of &quot;opaque&quot; substances.</i> In a short time the world was
 astonished to learn that we could photograph the skeleton in a living
 man&#39;s body, locate a penny in the interior of a child that had swallowed
 one, or take an impression of a coin through a slab of stone.</p>

 <p>And what are these X-rays? They are not a form of matter; they are not
 material particles. X-rays were found to be a new variety of <i>light</i>
 with a remarkable power of penetration. We have seen what the spectroscope
 reveals about the varying nature of light wave-lengths. Light-waves are set
 up by vibrations in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg
 256]</a></span> ether,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and, as we shall see, these ether
 disturbances are all of the same kind; they only differ as regards
 wave-lengths. The X-rays which Röntgen discovered, then, are light, but a
 variety of light previously unknown to us; they are ether waves of very short
 length. X-rays have proved of great value in many directions, as all the
 world knows, but that we need not discuss at this point. Let us see what
 followed Röntgen&#39;s discovery.</p>

 <div class="footnote">
  <p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href=
  "#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> We refer throughout to
  the &quot;ether&quot; because, although modern theories dispense largely
  with this conception, the theories of physics are so inextricably interwoven
  with it that it is necessary, in an elementary exposition, to assume its
  existence. The modern view will be explained later in the article on
  Einstein&#39;s Theory.</p>
 </div>

 <p>While the world wondered at these marvels, the men of science were eagerly
 following up the new clue to the mystery of matter which was exercising the
 mind of Crookes and other investigators. In 1896 Becquerel brought us to the
 threshold of the great discovery.</p>

 <p>Certain substances are phosphorescent&mdash;they become luminous after
 they have been exposed to sunlight for some time, and Becquerel was trying to
 find if any of these substances give rise to X-rays. One day he chose a salt
 of the metal uranium. He was going to see if, after exposing it to sunlight,
 he could photograph a cross with it through an opaque substance. He wrapped
 it up and laid it aside, to wait for the sun, but he found the uranium salt
 did not wait for the sun. Some strong radiation from it went through the
 opaque covering and made an impression of the cross upon the plate
 underneath. Light or darkness was immaterial. The mysterious rays streamed
 night and day from the salt. This was something new. Here was a substance
 which appeared to be producing X-rays; the rays emitted by uranium would
 penetrate the same opaque substances as the X-rays discovered by Röntgen.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Discovery of Radium</h4>

 <p>Now, at the same time as many other investigators, Professor Curie and his
 Polish wife took up the search. They decided to<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> find out whether the emission
 came from the uranium itself or <i>from something associated with it</i>, and
 for this purpose they made a chemical analysis of great quantities of
 minerals. They found a certain kind of pitchblende which was very active, and
 they analysed tons of it, concentrating always on the radiant element in it.
 After a time, as they successively worked out the non-radiant matter, the
 stuff began to glow. In the end they extracted from eight tons of pitchblende
 about half a teaspoonful of something <i>that was a million times more
 radiant than uranium</i>. There was only one name for it&mdash;Radium.</p>

 <p>That was the starting-point of the new development of physics and
 chemistry. From every laboratory in the world came a cry for radium salts (as
 pure radium was too precious), and hundreds of brilliant workers fastened on
 the new element. The inquiry was broadened, and, as year followed year, one
 substance after another was found to possess the power of emitting rays, that
 is, to be radio-active. We know to-day that nearly every form of matter can
 be stimulated to radio-activity; which, as we shall see, means that <i>its
 atoms break up into smaller and wonderfully energetic particles which we call
 &quot;electrons.&quot;</i> This discovery of electrons has brought about a
 complete change in our ideas in many directions.</p>

 <p>So, instead of atoms being indivisible, they are actually dividing
 themselves, spontaneously, and giving off throughout the universe tiny
 fragments of their substance. We shall explain presently what was later
 discovered about the electron; meanwhile we can say that every glowing metal
 is pouring out a stream of these electrons. Every arc-lamp is discharging
 them. Every clap of thunder means a shower of them. Every star is flooding
 space with them. We are witnessing the spontaneous breaking up of atoms,
 atoms which had been thought to be indivisible. The sun not only pours out
 streams of electrons from its own atoms, but the ultra-violet light which it
 sends to the earth is one of the most powerful agencies for releasing
 electrons from the surface-atoms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id=
 "Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> of matter on the earth. It is fortunate for us
 that our atmosphere absorbs most of this ultra-violet or invisible light of
 the sun&mdash;a kind of light which will be explained presently. It has been
 suggested that, if we received the full flood of it from the sun, our metals
 would disintegrate under its influence and this &quot;steel
 civilisation&quot; of ours would be impossible!</p>

 <p>But we are here anticipating, we are going beyond radium to the wonderful
 discoveries which were made by the chemists and physicists of the world who
 concentrated upon it. The work of Professor and Mme. Curie was merely the
 final clue to guide the great search. How it was followed up, how we
 penetrated into the very heart of the minute atom and discovered new and
 portentous mines of energy, and how we were able to understand, not only
 matter, but electricity and light, will be told in the next chapter.</p>

 <h3>THE DISCOVERY OF THE ELECTRON AND HOW IT EFFECTED A REVOLUTION IN
 IDEAS</h3>

 <p>What the discovery of radium implied was only gradually realised. Radium
 captivated the imagination of the world; it was a boon to medicine, but to
 the man of science it was at first a most puzzling and most attractive
 phenomenon. It was felt that some great secret of nature was dimly unveiled
 in its wonderful manifestations, and there now concentrated upon it as gifted
 a body of men&mdash;conspicuous amongst them Sir J. J. Thomson, Sir Ernest
 Rutherford, Sir W. Ramsay, and Professor Soddy&mdash;as any age could boast,
 with an apparatus of research as far beyond that of any other age as the
 <i>Aquitania</i> is beyond a Roman galley. Within five years the secret was
 fairly mastered. Not only were all kinds of matter reduced to a common basis,
 but the forces of the universe were brought into a unity and understood as
 they had never been understood before.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Discovery of the Electron</h4>

 <p>Physicists did not take long to discover that the radiation from radium
 was very like the radiation in a &quot;Crookes tube.&quot; It was quickly
 recognised, moreover, that both in the tube and in radium (and other metals)
 the atoms of matter were somehow breaking down.</p>

 <p>However, the first step was to recognise that there were three distinct
 and different rays that were given off by such metals as radium and uranium.
 Sir Ernest Rutherford christened them, after the first three letters of the
 Greek alphabet, the Alpha, the Beta, and Gamma rays. We are concerned chiefly
 with the second group and purpose here to deal with that group only.<a name=
 "FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class=
 "fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

 <div class="footnote">
  <p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href=
  "#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The &quot;Alpha
  rays&quot; were presently recognised as atoms of helium gas, shot out at the
  rate of 12,000 miles a second.</p>

  <p>The &quot;Gamma rays&quot; are <i>waves</i>, like the X-rays, not
  material particles. They appear to be a type of X-rays. They possess the
  remarkable power of penetrating opaque substances; they will pass through a
  foot of solid iron, for example.</p>
 </div>

 <p>The &quot;Beta rays,&quot; as they were at first called, have proved to be
 one of the most interesting discoveries that science ever made. They proved
 what Crookes had surmised about the radiations he discovered in his vacuum
 tube. But it was <i>not</i> a fourth state of matter that had been found, but
 a new <i>property</i> of matter, a property common to all atoms of matter.
 The Beta rays were later christened Electrons. They are particles of
 disembodied electricity, here spontaneously liberated from the atoms of
 matter: only when the electron was isolated from the atom was it recognised
 for the first time as a separate entity. Electrons, therefore, are a
 constituent of the atoms of matter, and we have discovered that they can be
 released from the atom by a variety of agencies. Electrons are to be found
 everywhere, forming part of every atom.</p>

 <p>&quot;An electron,&quot; Sir William Bragg says, &quot;can only maintain a
 separate existence if it is travelling at an immense rate, from one
 three-hundredth of the velocity of light upwards, that is to<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> say, at least
 600 <i>miles a second, or thereabouts</i>. Otherwise the electron sticks to
 the first atom it meets.&quot; These amazing particles may travel with the
 enormous velocity of from 10,000 to more than 100,000 miles a second. It was
 first learned that they are of an electrical nature, because they are bent
 out of their normal path if a magnet is brought near them. And this fact led
 to a further discovery: to one of those sensational estimates which the
 general public is apt to believe to be founded on the most abstruse
 speculations. The physicist set up a little chemical screen for the
 &quot;Beta rays&quot; to hit, and he so arranged his tube that only a narrow
 sheaf of the rays poured on to the screen. He then drew this sheaf of rays
 out of its course with a magnet, and he accurately measured the shift of the
 luminous spot on the screen where the rays impinged on it. But when he knows
 the exact intensity of his magnetic field&mdash;which he can control as he
 likes&mdash;and the amount of deviation it causes, and the mass of the moving
 particles, he can tell the speed of the moving particles which he thus
 diverts. These particles were being hurled out of the atoms of radium, or
 from the negative pole in a vacuum tube, at a speed which, in good
 conditions, reached nearly the velocity of light, i.e. nearly 186,000 miles a
 second.</p>

 <p>Their speed has, of course, been confirmed by numbers of experiments; and
 another series of experiments enabled physicists to determine the size of the
 particles. Only one of these need be described, to give the reader an idea
 how men of science arrived at their more startling results.</p>

 <p>Fog, as most people know, is thick in our great cities because the
 water-vapour gathers on the particles of dust and smoke that are in the
 atmosphere. This fact was used as the basis of some beautiful experiments.
 Artificial fogs were created in little glass tubes, by introducing dust, in
 various proportions, for supersaturated vapour to gather on. In the end it
 was possible to cause tiny drops of rain, each with a particle of dust at its
 core, to fall upon a silver mirror and be counted. It was a method of
 counting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg
 261]</a></span> the quite invisible particles of dust in the tube; and the
 method was now successfully applied to the new rays. Yet another method was
 to direct a slender stream of the particles upon a chemical screen. The
 screen glowed under the cannonade of particles, and a powerful lens resolved
 the glow into distinct sparks, which could be counted.</p>

 <p>In short, a series of the most remarkable and beautiful experiments,
 checked in all the great laboratories of the world, settled the nature of
 these so-called rays. They were streams of particles more than a thousand
 times smaller than the smallest known atom. The mass of each particle is,
 according to the latest and finest measurements 1/1845 of that of an atom of
 hydrogen. The physicist has not been able to find any character except
 electricity in them, and the name &quot;electrons&quot; has been generally
 adopted.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Key to many Mysteries</h4>

 <p>The Electron is an atom, of disembodied electricity; it occupies an
 exceedingly small volume, and its &quot;mass&quot; is entirely electrical.
 These electrons are the key to half the mysteries of matter. Electrons in
 rapid motion, as we shall see, explain what we mean by an &quot;electric
 current,&quot; not so long ago regarded as one of the most mysterious
 manifestations in nature.</p>

 <p>&quot;What a wonder, then, have we here!&quot; says Professor R. K.
 Duncan. &quot;An innocent-looking little pinch of salt and yet possessed of
 special properties utterly beyond even the fanciful imaginings of men of past
 time; for nowhere do we find in the records of thought even the hint of the
 possibility of things which we now regard as established fact. This pinch of
 salt projects from its surface bodies [i.e. electrons] possessing the
 inconceivable velocity of over 100,000 miles a second, a velocity sufficient
 to carry them, if unimpeded, five times around the earth in a second, and
 possessing with this velocity, masses a thousand times smaller than the
 smallest atom known to science. Furthermore,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> they are charged with negative
 electricity; they pass straight through bodies considered opaque with a
 sublime indifference to the properties of the body, with the exception of its
 mere density; they cause bodies which they strike to shine out in the dark;
 they affect a photographic plate; they render the air a conductor of
 electricity; they cause clouds in moist air; they cause chemical action and
 have a peculiar physiological action. Who, to-day, shall predict the ultimate
 service to humanity of the beta-rays from radium!&quot;</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 6</h3>

 <h3>THE ELECTRON THEORY, OR THE NEW VIEW OF MATTER</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Structure of the Atom</h4>

 <p>There is general agreement amongst all chemists, physicists, and
 mathematicians upon the conclusions which we have so far given. We know that
 the atoms of matter are constantly&mdash;either spontaneously or under
 stimulation&mdash;giving off electrons, or breaking up into electrons; and
 they therefore contain electrons. Thus we have now complete proof of the
 independent existence of atoms and also of electrons.</p>

 <p>When, however, the man of science tries to tell us <i>how</i> electrons
 compose atoms, he passes from facts to speculation, and very difficult
 speculation. Take the letter &quot;o&quot; as it is printed on this page. In
 a little bubble of hydrogen gas no larger than that letter there are
 <i>trillions</i> of atoms; and they are not packed together, but are
 circulating as freely as dancers in a ball-room. We are asking the physicist
 to take one of these minute atoms and tell us how the still smaller electrons
 are arranged in it. Naturally he can only make mental pictures, guesses or
 hypotheses, which he tries to fit to the facts, and discards when they will
 <i>not</i> fit.</p>

 <p>At present, after nearly twenty years of critical discussion, there are
 two chief theories of the structure of the atom. At first<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> Sir J. J.
 Thomson imagined the electrons circulating in shells (like the layers of an
 onion) round the nucleus of the atom. This did not suit, and Sir E.
 Rutherford and others worked out a theory that the electrons circulated round
 a nucleus rather like the planets of our solar system revolving round the
 central sun. Is there a nucleus, then, round which the electrons revolve? The
 electron, as we saw, is a disembodied atom of electricity; we should say, of
 &quot;negative&quot; electricity. Let us picture these electrons all moving
 round in orbits with great velocity. Now it is suggested that there is a
 nucleus of &quot;positive&quot; electricity attracting or pulling the
 revolving electrons to it, and so forming an equilibrium, otherwise the
 electrons would fly off in all directions. This nucleus has been recently
 named the proton. We have thus two electricities in the atom: the positive =
 the nucleus; the negative = the electron. Of recent years Dr. Langmuir has
 put out a theory that the electrons do not <i>revolve round</i> the nucleus,
 but remain in a state of violent agitation of some sort at fixed distances
 from the nucleus.</p>

 <p>But we will confine ourselves here to the facts, and leave the contending
 theories to scientific men. It is now pretty generally accepted that an atom
 of matter consists of a number of electrons, or charges of negative
 electricity, held together by a charge of positive electricity. It is not
 disputed that these electrons are in a state of violent motion or strain, and
 that therefore a vast energy is locked up in the atoms of matter. To that we
 will return later. Here, rather, we will notice another remarkable discovery
 which helps us to understand the nature of matter.</p>

 <p>A brilliant young man of science who was killed in the war, Mr. Moseley,
 some years ago showed that, when the atoms of different substances are
 arranged in order of their weight, <i>they are also arranged in the order of
 increasing complexity of structure</i>. That is to say, the heavier the atom,
 the more electrons it contains. There is a gradual building up of atoms
 containing more and more electrons from the lightest atom to the
 heaviest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg
 264]</a></span> Here it is enough to say that as he took element after
 element, from the lightest (hydrogen) to the heaviest (uranium) he found a
 strangely regular relation between them. If hydrogen were represented by the
 figure one, helium by two, lithium three, and so on up to uranium, then
 uranium should have the figure ninety-two. This makes it probable that there
 are in nature ninety-two elements&mdash;we have found eighty-seven&mdash;and
 that the number Mr. Moseley found is the number of electrons in the atom of
 each element; that is to say, the number is arranged in order of the atomic
 numbers of the various elements.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 7</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The New View of Matter</h4>

 <p>Up to the point we have reached, then, we see what the new view of Matter
 is. Every atom of matter, of whatever kind throughout the whole universe, is
 built up of electrons in conjunction with a nucleus. From the smallest atom
 of all&mdash;the atom of hydrogen&mdash;which consists of one electron,
 rotating round a positively charged nucleus, to a heavy complicated atom,
 such as the atom of gold, constituted of many electrons and a complex
 nucleus, <i>we have only to do with positive and negative units of
 electricity</i>. The electron and its nucleus are particles of electricity.
 All Matter, therefore, is nothing but a manifestation of electricity. The
 atoms of matter, as we saw, combine and form molecules. Atoms and molecules
 are the bricks out of which nature has built up everything; ourselves, the
 earth, the stars, the whole universe.</p>

 <p>But more than bricks are required to build a house. There are other
 fundamental existences, such as the various forms of energy, which give rise
 to several complex problems. And we have also to remember, that there are
 more than eighty distinct elements, each with its own definite type of atom.
 We shall deal with energy later. Meanwhile it remains to be said that,
 although we have discovered a great deal about the electron and the
 constitution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg
 265]</a></span> of matter, and that while the physicists of our own day seem
 to see a possibility of explaining positive and negative electricity, the
 nature of them both is unknown. There exists the theory that the particles of
 positive and negative electricity, which make up the atoms of matter, are
 points or centres of disturbances of some kind in a universal ether, and that
 all the various forms of energy are, in some fundamental way, aspects of the
 same primary entity which constitutes matter itself.</p>

 <p>But the discovery of the property of radio-activity has raised many other
 interesting questions, besides that which we have just dealt with. In
 radio-active elements, such as uranium for example, the element is breaking
 down; in what we call radio-activity we have a manifestation of the
 spontaneous change of elements. What is really taking place is a
 transmutation of one element into another, from a heavier to a lighter. The
 element uranium spontaneously becomes radium, and radium passes through a
 number of other stages until it, in turn, becomes lead. Each descending
 element is of lighter atomic weight than its predecessor. The changing
 process, of course, is a very slow one. It may be that all matter is
 radio-active, or can be made so. This raises the question whether all the
 matter in the universe may not undergo disintegration.</p>

 <p>There is, however, another side of the question, which the discovery of
 radio-activity has brought to light, and which has effected a revolution in
 our views. We have seen that in radio-active substances the elements are
 breaking down. Is there a process of building up at work? If the more
 complicated atoms are breaking down into simpler forms, may there not be a
 converse process&mdash;a building up from simpler elements to more
 complicated elements? It is probably the case that both processes are at
 work.</p>

 <p>There are some eighty-odd chemical elements on the earth to-day: are they
 all the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element giving rise to element,
 going back and back to some primeval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266"
 id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> stuff from which they were all originally
 derived infinitely long ago? Is there an evolution in the inorganic world
 which may be going on, parallel to that of the evolution of living things; or
 is organic evolution a continuation of inorganic evolution? We have seen what
 evidence there is of this inorganic evolution in the case of the stars. We
 cannot go deeply into the matter here, nor has the time come for any direct
 statement that can be based on the findings of modern investigation. Taking
 it altogether the evidence is steadily accumulating, and there are
 authorities who maintain that already the evidence of inorganic evolution is
 convincing enough. The heavier atoms would appear to behave as though they
 were evolved from the lighter. The more complex forms, it is supposed, have
 <i>evolved</i> from the simpler forms. Moseley&#39;s discovery, to which
 reference has been made, points to the conclusion that the elements are built
 up one from another.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 8</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Other New Views</h4>

 <p>We may here refer to another new conception to which the discovery of
 radio-activity has given rise. Lord Kelvin, who estimated the age of the
 earth at twenty million years, reached this estimate by considering the earth
 as a body which is gradually cooling down, &quot;losing its primitive heat,
 like a loaf taken from the oven, at a rate which could be calculated, and
 that the heat radiated by the sun was due to contraction.&quot; Uranium and
 radio-activity were not known to Kelvin, and their discovery has upset both
 his arguments. Radio-active substances, which are perpetually giving out
 heat, introduce an entirely new factor. We cannot now assume that the earth
 is necessarily cooling down; it may even, for all we know, be getting hotter.
 At the 1921 meeting of the British Association, Professor Rayleigh stated
 that further knowledge had extended the probable period during which there
 had been life on this globe to about one thousand<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> million years,
 and the total age of the earth to some small multiple of that. The earth, he
 considers, is not cooling, but &quot;contains an internal source of heat from
 the disintegration of uranium in the outer crust.&quot; On the whole the
 estimate obtained would seem to be in agreement with the geological
 estimates. The question, of course, cannot, in the present state of our
 knowledge, be settled within fixed limits that meet with general
 agreement.</p>

 <p>As we have said, there are other fundamental existences which give rise to
 more complex problems. The three great fundamental entities in the physical

 there is nothing. We have dealt with matter, there remain ether and energy.

 created or destroyed, and just as there is no such thing as empty
 space&mdash;ether pervades everything&mdash;so there is no such thing as
 <i>rest</i>. Every particle that goes to make up our solid earth is in a
 state of perpetual unremitting vibration; energy &quot;is the universal

 three fundamental entities&mdash;matter, ether, and energy&mdash;may appear,
 it may be that, after all, they are only different and mysterious phases of
 an essential &quot;oneness&quot; of the universe.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 9</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Future</h4>

 <p>Let us, in concluding this chapter, give just one illustration of the way
 in which all this new knowledge may prove to be as valuable practically as it
 is wonderful intellectually. We saw that electrons are shot out of atoms at a
 speed that may approach 160,000 miles a second. Sir Oliver Lodge has written
 recently that a seventieth of a grain of radium discharges, at a speed a
 thousand times that of a rifle bullet, thirty million electrons a second.
 Professor Le Bon has calculated that it would take 1,340,000 barrels of
 powder to give a bullet the speed of one of these electrons. He shows that
 the smallest French copper coin&mdash;smaller<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> than a farthing&mdash;contains
 an energy equal to eighty million horsepower. A few pounds of matter contain
 more energy than we could extract from millions of tons of coal. Even in the
 atoms of hydrogen at a temperature which we could produce in an electric
 furnace the electrons spin round at a rate of nearly a hundred trillion
 revolutions a second!</p>

 <p>Every man asks at once: &quot;Will science ever tap this energy?&quot; If
 it does, no more smoke, no mining, no transit, no bulky fuel. The energy of
 an atom is of course only liberated when an atom passes from one state to
 another. The stored up energy is fortunately fast bound by the electrons
 being held together as has been described. If it were not so &quot;the earth
 would explode and become a gaseous nebula&quot;! It is believed that some day
 we shall be able to release, harness, and utilise atomic energy. &quot;I am
 of opinion,&quot; says Sir William Bragg, &quot;that atom energy will supply
 our future need. A thousand years may pass before we can harness the atom, or
 to-morrow might see us with the reins in our hands. That is the peculiarity
 of Physics&mdash;research and &#39;accidental&#39; discovery go hand in
 hand.&quot; Half a brick contains as much energy as a small coal-field. The
 difficulties are tremendous, but, as Sir Oliver Lodge reminds us, there was
 just as much scepticism at one time about the utilisation of steam or
 electricity. &quot;Is it to be supposed,&quot; he asks, &quot;that there can
 be no fresh invention, that all the discoveries have been made?&quot; More
 than one man of science encourages us to hope. Here are some remarkable words
 written by Professor Soddy, one of the highest authorities on radio-active
 matter, in our chief scientific weekly (<i>Nature</i>, November 6, 1919):</p>

 <div class="blockquot">
  <p>The prospects of the successful accomplishment of artificial
  transmutation brighten almost daily. The ancients seem to have had something
  more than an inkling that the accomplishment of transmutation would confer
  upon men powers hitherto the prerogative of the gods. But now we know
  definitely that the material aspect of transmutation<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> would be of
  small importance in comparison with the control over the inexhaustible
  stores of internal atomic energy to which its successful accomplishment
  would inevitably lead. It has become a problem, no longer redolent of the
  evil associations of the age of alchemy, but one big with the promise of a
  veritable physical renaissance of the whole world.</p>
 </div>

 <p>If that &quot;promise&quot; is ever realised, the economic and social face
 of the world will be transformed.</p>

 <p>Before passing on to the consideration of ether, light, and energy, let us
 see what new light the discovery of the electron has thrown on the nature and
 manipulation of electricity.</p>

 <h3>WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">The Nature of Electricity</h4>

 <p>There is at least one manifestation in nature, and so late as twenty years
 ago it seemed to be one of the most mysterious manifestations of all, which
 has been in great measure explained by the new discoveries. Already, at the
 beginning of this century, we spoke of our &quot;age of electricity,&quot;
 yet there were few things in nature about which we knew less. The
 &quot;electric current&quot; rang our bells, drove our trains, lit our rooms,
 but none knew what the current was. There was a vague idea that it was a sort
 of fluid that flowed along copper wires as water flows in a pipe. We now
 suppose that it is <i>a rapid movement of electrons from atom to atom</i> in
 the wire or wherever the current is.</p>

 <p>Let us try to grasp the principle of the new view of electricity and see
 how it applies to all the varied electrical phenomena in the world about us.
 As we saw, the nucleus of an atom of matter consists of positive electricity
 which holds together a number of electrons, or charges of negative
 electricity.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href=
 "#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> certainly tells us to some
 extent what electricity is, and how it is related to matter, but it leaves us
 with the usual difficulty about fundamental realities. But we now know that
 electricity, like matter, is atomic in structure; a charge of electricity is
 made up of a number of small units or charges of a definite, constant amount.
 It has been suggested that the two kinds of electricity, i.e. positive and
 negative, are right-handed and left-handed vortices or whirlpools in ether,
 or rings in ether, but there are very serious difficulties, and we leave this
 to the future.</p>

 <div class="footnote">
  <p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href=
  "#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The words
  &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; electricity belong to the days
  when it was regarded as a fluid. A body overcharged with the fluid was
  called positive; an undercharged body was called negative. A
  positively-electrified body is now one whose atoms have lost some of their
  outlying electrons, so that the positive charge of electricity predominates.
  The negatively-electrified body is one with more than the normal number of
  electrons.</p>
 </div>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 10</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">What an Electric Current is</h4>

 <p>The discovery of these two kinds of electricity has, however, enabled us
 to understand very fairly what goes on in electrical phenomena. The outlying
 electrons, as we saw, may pass from atom to atom, and this, on a large scale,
 is the meaning of the electric current. In other words, we believe an
 electric current to be a flow of electrons. Let us take, to begin with, a
 simple electrical &quot;cell,&quot; in which a feeble current is generated:
 such a cell as there is in every house to serve its electric bells.</p>

 <p>In the original form this simple sort of &quot;battery&quot; consisted of
 a plate of zinc and a plate of copper immersed in a chemical. Long before
 anything was known about electrons it was known that, if you put zinc and
 copper together, you produce a mild current of electricity. We know now what
 this means. Zinc is a metal the atoms of which are particularly disposed to
 part with some of their outlying electrons. Why, we do not know; but the fact
 is the basis of these small batteries. Electrons from the atoms of zinc pass
 to the atoms of copper, and their passage is a &quot;current.&quot; Each atom
 gives up an electron to its neighbour. It was further found long ago that if
 the zinc and copper were immersed in certain chemicals, which slowly dissolve
 the zinc, and the two metals were connected by a copper wire, the current was
 stronger. In modern language, there is a brisker flow of<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> electrons. The
 reason is that the atoms of zinc which are stolen by the chemical leave their
 detachable electrons behind them, and the zinc has therefore more electrons
 to pass on to the copper.</p>

   Radium passes through a number of further changes, as shown in the diagram,

   faster than others. Thus Uranium changes very slowly, taking 5,000,000,000
   years to reach the same stage of disintegration that Radium A reaches in 3
   minutes. As the disintegration proceeds, the substances become of lighter
   and lighter atomic weights. Thus Uranium has an atomic weight of 238,

 </div>

 <p>Such cells are now made of zinc and carbon, immersed in sal-ammoniac, but
 the principle is the same. The flow of electricity is a flow of electrons;
 though we ought to repeat that they do not flow in a body, as molecules of
 water do. You may have seen boys place a row of bricks, each standing on one
 end, in such order that the first, if it is pushed, will knock over the
 second, the second the third, and so on to the last. There is a flow of
 <i>movement</i> all along the line, but each brick moves only a short
 distance. So an electron merely passes to the next atom, which sends on an
 electron to a third atom, and so on. In this case, however, the movement from
 atom to atom is so rapid that the ripple of movement, if we may call it so,
 may pass along at an enormous speed. We have seen how swiftly electrons
 travel.</p>

 <p>But how is this turned into power enough even to ring a bell? The actual
 mechanical apparatus by which the energy of the electron current is turned
 into sound, or heat, or light will be described in a technical section later
 in this work. We are concerned here only with the principle, which is clear.
 While zinc is very apt to part with electrons, copper is just as obliging in
 facilitating their passage onward. Electrons will travel in this way in most
 metals, but copper is one of the best &quot;conductors.&quot; So we lengthen
 the copper wire between the zinc and the carbon until it goes as far as the
 front door and the bell, which are included in the circuit. When you press
 the button at the door, two wires are brought together, and the current of
 electrons rushes round the circuit; and at the bell its energy is diverted
 into the mechanical apparatus which rings the bell.</p>

 <p>Copper is a good conductor&mdash;six times as good as iron&mdash;and is
 therefore so common in electrical industries. Some other substances are just
 as stubborn as copper is yielding, and we call them &quot;insulators,&quot;
 because they resist the current instead of letting<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> it flow. Their
 atoms do not easily part with electrons. Glass, vulcanite, and porcelain are
 very good insulators for this reason.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">What the Dynamo does</h4>

 <p>But even several cells together do not produce the currents needed in
 modern industry, and the flow is produced in a different manner. As the
 invisible electrons pass along a wire they produce what we call a magnetic
 field around the wire, they produce a disturbance in the surrounding ether.
 To be exact, it is through the ether surrounding the wire that the energy
 originated by the electrons is transmitted. To set electrons moving on a
 large scale we use a &quot;dynamo.&quot; By means of the dynamo it is
 possible to transform mechanical energy into electrical energy. The modern
 dynamo, as Professor Soddy puts it, may be looked upon as an electron pump.
 We cannot go into the subject deeply here, we would only say that a large
 coil of copper wire is caused to turn round rapidly between the poles of a
 powerful magnet. That is the essential construction of the
 &quot;dynamo,&quot; which is used for generating strong currents. We shall
 see in a moment how magnetism differs from electricity, and will say here
 only that round the poles of a large magnet there is a field of intense
 disturbance which will start a flow of electrons in any copper that is
 introduced into it. On account of the speed given to the coil of wire its
 atoms enter suddenly this magnetic field, and they give off crowds of
 electrons in a flash.</p>

 <p>It is found that a similar disturbance is caused, though the flow is in
 the <i>opposite</i> direction, when the coil of wire leaves the magnetic
 field. And as the coil is revolving very rapidly we get a powerful current of
 electricity that runs in alternate directions&mdash;an
 &quot;alternating&quot; current. Electricians have apparatus for converting
 it into a continuous current where this is necessary.</p>

 <p>A current, therefore, means a steady flow of the electrons from atom to
 atom. Sometimes, however, a number of electrons<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> rush violently and explosively
 from one body to another, as in the electric spark or the occasional flash
 from an electric tram or train. The grandest and most spectacular display of
 this phenomenon is the thunderstorm. As we saw earlier, a portentous furnace
 like the sun is constantly pouring floods of electrons from its atoms into
 space. The earth intercepts great numbers of these electrons. In the upper
 regions of the air the stream of solar electrons has the effect of separating
 positively-electrified atoms from negatively-electrified ones, and the
 water-vapour, which is constantly rising from the surface of the sea, gathers
 more freely round the positively-electrified atoms, and brings them down, as
 rain, to the earth. Thus the upper air loses a proportion of positive
 electricity, or becomes &quot;negatively electrified.&quot; In the
 thunderstorm we get both kinds of clouds&mdash;some with large excesses of
 electrons, and some deficient in electrons&mdash;and the tension grows until
 at last it is relieved by a sudden and violent discharge of electrons from
 one cloud to another or to the earth&mdash;an electric spark on a prodigious
 scale.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 11</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Magnetism</h4>

 <p>We have seen that an electric current is really a flow of electrons. Now
 an electric current exhibits a magnetic effect. The surrounding space is
 endowed with energy which we call electro-magnetic energy. A piece of
 magnetised iron attracting other pieces of iron to it is the popular idea of
 a magnet. If we arrange a wire to pass vertically through a piece of
 cardboard and then sprinkle iron filings on the cardboard we shall find that,
 on passing an electric current through the wire, the iron filings arrange
 themselves in circles round it. The magnetic force, due to the electric
 current, seems to exist in circles round the wire, an ether disturbance being
 set up. Even a single electron, when in movement, creates a magnetic
 &quot;field,&quot; as it is called, round its path. There is no movement of
 electrons without this attendant field<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> of energy, and their motion is
 not stopped until that field of energy disappears from the ether. The modern
 theory of magnetism supposes that all magnetism is produced in this way. All
 magnetism is supposed to arise from the small whirling motions of the
 electrons contained in the ultimate atoms of matter. We cannot here go into
 the details of the theory nor explain why, for instance, iron behaves so
 differently from other substances, but it is sufficient to say that here,
 also, the electron theory provides the key. This theory is not yet definitely
 <i>proved</i>, but it furnishes a sufficient theoretical basis for future
 research. The earth itself is a gigantic magnet, a fact which makes the
 compass possible, and it is well known that the earth&#39;s magnetism is
 affected by those great outbreaks on the sun called sun-spots. Now it has
 been recently shown that a sun-spot is a vast whirlpool of electrons and that
 it exerts a strong magnetic action. There is doubtless a connection between
 these outbreaks of electronic activity and the consequent changes in the
 earth&#39;s magnetism. The precise mechanism of the connection, however, is
 still a matter that is being investigated.</p>

 <h3>ETHER AND WAVES</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Ether and Waves</h4>

 <p>The whole material universe is supposed to be embedded in a vast medium
 called the ether. It is true that the notion of the ether has been abandoned
 by some modern physicists, but, whether or not it is ultimately dispensed
 with, the conception of the ether has entered so deeply into the scientific
 mind that the science of physics cannot be understood unless we know
 something about the properties attributed to the ether. The ether was
 invented to explain the phenomena of light, and to account for the flow of
 energy across empty space. Light takes time to travel. We see the sun at any
 moment by the light that left it 8 minutes before. It has taken that 8
 minutes for the light from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id=
 "Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> sun to travel that 93,000,000 miles odd which
 separates it from our earth. Besides the fact that light takes time to
 travel, it can be shown that light travels in the form of waves. We know that
 sound travels in waves; sound consists of waves in the air, or water or wood
 or whatever medium we hear it through. If an electric bell be put in a glass
 jar and the air be pumped out of the jar, the sound of the bell becomes
 feebler and feebler until, when enough air has been taken out, we do not hear
 the bell at all. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum. We continue to <i>see</i>
 the bell, however, so that evidently light can travel in a vacuum. The
 invisible medium through which the waves of light travel is the ether, and
 this ether permeates all space <i>and all matter</i>. Between us and the
 stars stretch vast regions empty of all matter. But we see the stars; their
 light reaches us, even though it may take centuries to do so. We conceive,
 then, that it is the universal ether which conveys that light. All the energy
 which has reached the earth from the sun and which, stored for ages in our
 coal-fields, is now used to propel our trains and steamships, to heat and
 light our cities, to perform all the multifarious tasks of modern life, was
 conveyed by the ether. Without that universal carrier of energy we should
 have nothing but a stagnant, lifeless world.</p>

   <p>AN ETHER DISTURBANCE AROUND AN ELECTRON CURRENT</p>

   <p class="wide">In the left-hand photograph an electric current is passing
   through the coil, thus producing a magnetic field and transforming the
   poker into a magnet. The poker is then able to support a pair of scissors.
   As soon as the electric current is broken off, as in the second photograph,
   the ether disturbance ceases. The poker loses its magnetism, and the
   scissors fall.</p>
  </div>
 </div>

 <p>We have said that light consists of waves. The ether may be considered as
 resembling, in some respects, a jelly. It can transmit vibrations. The waves
 of light are really excessively small ripples, measuring from crest to crest.
 The distance from crest to crest of the ripples in a pond is sometimes no
 more than an inch or two. This distance is enormously great compared to the
 longest of the wave-lengths that constitute light. We say the longest, for
 the waves of light differ in length; the colour depends upon the length of
 the light. Red light has the longest waves and violet the shortest. The
 longest waves, the waves of deep-red light, are seven two hundred and fifty
 thousandths of an inch in length (7/250,000 inch). This is nearly twice the
 length<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg
 276]</a></span> of deep-violet light-waves, which are 1/67,000 inch. But
 light-waves, the waves that affect the eye, are not the only waves carried by
 the ether. Waves too short to affect the eye can affect the photographic
 plate, and we can discover in this way the existence of waves only half the
 length of the deep-violet waves. Still shorter waves can be discovered, until
 we come to those excessively minute rays, the X-rays.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Below the Limits of Visibility</h4>

 <p>But we can extend our investigations in the other direction; we find that
 the ether carries many waves longer than light-waves. Special photographic
 emulsions can reveal the existence of waves five times longer than
 violet-light waves. Extending below the limits of visibility are waves we
 detect as heat-waves. Radiant heat, like the heat from a fire, is also a form
 of wave-motion in the ether, but the waves our senses recognise as heat are
 longer than light-waves. There are longer waves still, but our senses do not
 recognise them. But we can detect them by our instruments. These are the
 waves used in wireless telegraphy, and their length may be, in some cases,
 measured in miles. These waves are the so-called electro-magnetic waves.
 Light, radiant heat, and electro-magnetic waves are all of the same nature;
 they differ only as regards their wave-lengths.</p>

 <h3>LIGHT&mdash;VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE</h3>

 <p>If Light, then, consists of waves transmitted through the ether, what
 gives rise to the waves? Whatever sets up such wonderfully rapid series of
 waves must be something with an enormous vibration. We come back to the
 electron: all atoms of matter, as we have seen, are made up of electrons
 revolving in a regular orbit round a nucleus. These electrons may be affected
 by out-side influences, they may be agitated and their speed or vibration
 increased.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg
 277]</a></span></p>

 <h4 class="sect">Electrons and Light</h4>

 <p>The particles even of a piece of cold iron are in a state of vibration. No
 nerves of ours are able to feel and register the waves they emit, but your
 cold poker is really radiating, or sending out a series of wave-movements, on
 every side. After what we saw about the nature of matter, this will surprise
 none. Put your poker in the fire for a time. The particles of the glowing
 coal, which are violently agitated, communicate some of their energy to the
 particles of iron in the poker. They move to and fro more rapidly, and the
 waves which they create are now able to affect your nerves and cause a
 sensation of heat. Put the poker again in the fire, until its temperature
 rises to 500° C. It begins to glow with a dull red. Its particles are now
 moving very violently, and the waves they send out are so short and rapid
 that they can be picked up by the eye&mdash;we have <i>visible</i> light.
 They would still not affect a photographic plate. Heat the iron further, and
 the crowds of electrons now send out waves of various lengths which blend
 into white light. What is happening is the agitated electrons flying round in
 their orbits at a speed of trillions of times a second. Make the iron
 &quot;blue hot,&quot; and it pours out, in addition to light, the
 <i>invisible</i> waves which alter the film on the photographic plate. And
 beyond these there is a long range of still shorter waves, culminating in the
 X-rays, which will pass between the atoms of flesh or stone.</p>

 <p>Nearly two hundred and fifty years ago it was proved that light travelled
 at least 600,000 times faster than sound. Jupiter, as we saw, has moons,
 which circle round it. They pass behind the body of the planet, and reappear
 at the other side. But it was noticed that, when Jupiter is at its greatest
 distance from us, the reappearance of the moon from behind it is 16 minutes
 and 36 seconds later than when the planet is nearest to us. Plainly this was
 because light took so long to cover the additional distance. The distance was
 then imperfectly known, and the speed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278"
 id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> of light was underrated. We now know the
 distance, and we easily get the velocity of light.</p>

 <p>No doubt it seems far more wonderful to discover this within the walls of
 a laboratory, but it was done as long ago as 1850. A cogged wheel is so
 mounted that a ray of light passes between two of the teeth and is reflected
 back from a mirror. Now, slight as is the fraction of a second which light
 takes to travel that distance, it is possible to give such speed to the wheel
 that the next tooth catches the ray of light on its return and cuts it off.
 The speed is increased still further until the ray of light returns to the
 eye of the observer through the notch <i>next</i> to the one by which it had
 passed to the mirror! The speed of the wheel was known, and it was thus
 possible again to gather the velocity of light. If the shortest waves are
 1/67,000 of an inch in length, and light travels at 186,000 miles a second,
 any person can work out that about 800 trillion waves enter the eye in a
 second when we see &quot;violet.&quot;</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Sorting out Light-waves</h4>

 <p>The waves sent out on every side by the energetic electrons become faintly
 visible to us when they reach about 1/35,000 of an inch. As they become
 shorter and more rapid, as the electrons increase their speed, we get, in
 succession, the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.
 Each distinct sensation of colour means a wave of different length. When they
 are all mingled together, as in the light of the sun, we get white light.
 When this white light passes through glass, the speed of the waves is
 lessened; and, if the ray of light falls obliquely on a triangular piece of
 glass, the waves of different lengths part company as they travel through it,
 and the light is spread out in a band of rainbow-colour. The waves are sorted
 out according to their lengths in the &quot;obstacle race&quot; through the
 glass. Anyone may see this for himself by holding up a wedge-shaped piece of
 crystal between the sunlight and the eye; the prism separates the<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> sunlight into
 its constituent colours, and these various colours will be seen quite
 readily. Or the thing may be realised in another way. If the seven colours
 are painted on a wheel as shown opposite page 280 (in the proportion shown),
 and the wheel rapidly revolved on a pivot, the wheel will appear a dull
 white, the several colours will not be seen. But <i>omit</i> one of the
 colours, then the wheel, when revolved, will not appear white, but will give
 the impression of one colour, corresponding to what the union of six colours
 gives. Another experiment will show that some bodies held up between the eye
 and a white light will not permit all the rays to pass through, but will
 intercept some; a body that intercepts all the seven rays except red will
 give the impression of red, or if all the rays except violet, then violet
 will be the colour seen.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Fate of the World</h4>

 <p>Professor Soddy has given an interesting picture of what might happen when
 the sun&#39;s light and heat is no longer what it is. The human eye &quot;has
 adapted itself through the ages to the peculiarities of the sun&#39;s light,
 so as to make the most of that wave-length of which there is most.... Let us
 indulge for a moment in these gloomy prognostications, as to the consequences
 to this earth of the cooling of the sun with the lapse of ages, which used to
 be in vogue, but which radio-activity has so rudely shaken. Picture the fate
 of the world when the sun has become a dull red-hot ball, or even when it has
 cooled so far that it would no longer emit light to us. That does not all
 mean that the world would be in inky darkness, and that the sun would not
 emit light to the people then inhabiting this world, if any had survived and
 could keep themselves from freezing. To such, if the eye continued to adapt
 itself to the changing conditions, our blues and violets would be
 ultra-violet and invisible, but our dark heat would be light and hot bodies
 would be luminous to them which would be dark to us.&quot;<span class=

 <h3 class="dim">§ 12</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">What the Blue &quot;Sky&quot; means</h4>

 <p>We saw in a previous chapter how the spectroscope splits up light-waves
 into their colours. But nature is constantly splitting the light into its
 different-lengthed waves, its colours. The rainbow, where dense moisture in
 the air acts as a spectroscope, is the most familiar example. A piece of
 mother-of-pearl, or even a film of oil on the street or on water, has the
 same effect, owing to the fine inequalities in its surface. The atmosphere
 all day long is sorting out the waves. The blue &quot;sky&quot; overhead
 means that the fine particles in the upper atmosphere catch the shorter
 waves, the blue waves, and scatter them. We can make a tubeful of blue sky in
 the laboratory at any time. The beautiful pink-flush on the Alps at sunrise,
 the red glory that lingers in the west at sunset, mean that, as the sun&#39;s
 rays must struggle through denser masses of air when it is low on the
 horizon, the long red waves are sifted out from the other shafts.</p>

 <p>Then there is the varied face of nature which, by absorbing some waves and
 reflecting others, weaves its own beautiful robe of colour. Here and there is
 a black patch, which <i>absorbs</i> all the light. White surfaces
 <i>reflect</i> the whole of it. What is reflected depends on the period of
 vibration of the electrons in the particular kind of matter. Generally, as
 the electrons receive the flood of trillions of waves, they absorb either the
 long or the medium or the short, and they give us the wonderful colour-scheme
 of nature. In some cases the electrons continue to radiate long after the
 sunlight has ceased to fall upon them. We get from them &quot;black&quot; or
 invisible light, and we can take photographs by it. Other bodies, like glass,
 vibrate in unison with the period of the light-waves and let them stream
 through.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Light without Heat</h4>

 <p>There are substances&mdash;&quot;phosphorescent&quot; things we call
 them&mdash;which give out a mysterious cold light of their own. It is
 one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
 of the problems of science, and one of profound practical interest. If we
 could produce light without heat our &quot;gas bill&quot; would shrink
 amazingly. So much energy is wasted in the production of heat-waves and
 ultra-violet waves which we do not want, that 90 per cent. or more of the
 power used in illumination is wasted. Would that the glow-worm, or even the
 dead herring, would yield us its secret! Phosphorus is the one thing we know
 as yet that suits the purpose, and&mdash;it smells! Indeed, our artificial
 light is not only extravagant in cost, but often poor in colour. The unwary
 person often buys a garment by artificial light, and is disgusted next
 morning to find in it a colour which is not wanted. The colour disclosed by
 the sun was not in the waves of the artificial light.</p>

 <p>Beyond the waves of violet light are the still shorter and more rapid
 waves&mdash;the &quot;ultra-violet&quot; waves&mdash;which are precious to
 the photographer. As every amateur knows, his plate may safely be exposed to
 light that comes through a red or an orange screen. Such a screen means
 &quot;no thoroughfare&quot; for the blue and &quot;beyond-blue&quot; waves,
 and it is these which arrange the little grains of silver on the plate. It is
 the same waves which supply the energy to the little green grains of matter
 (chlorophyll) in the plant, preparing our food and timber for us, as will be
 seen later. The tree struggles upward and spreads out its leaves fanwise to
 the blue sky to receive them. In our coal-measures, the mighty dead forests
 of long ago, are vast stores of sunlight which we are prodigally using
 up.</p>

 <p>The X-rays are the extreme end, the highest octave, of the series of
 waves. Their power of penetration implies that they are excessively minute,
 but even these have not held their secret from the modern physicist. From a
 series of beautiful experiments, in which they were made to pass amongst the
 atoms of a crystal, we learned their length. It is about the ten-millionth of
 a millimetre, and a millimetre is about the 1/25 of an inch!</p>

 <p>One of the most recent discoveries, made during a recent<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> eclipse of the
 sun, is that light is subject to gravitation. A ray of light from a star is
 bent out of its straight path when it passes near the mass of the sun.
 Professor Eddington tells us that we have as much right to speak of a pound
 of light as of a pound of sugar. Professor Eddington even calculates that the
 earth receives 160 tons of light from the sun every year!</p>

 <h3>ENERGY: HOW ALL LIFE DEPENDS ON IT</h3>

 <p>As we have seen in an earlier chapter, one of the fundamental entities of
 the universe is matter. A second, not less important, is called energy.
 Energy is indispensable if the world is to continue to exist, since all
 phenomena, including life, depend on it. Just as it is humanly impossible to
 create or to destroy a particle of matter, so is it impossible to create or
 to destroy energy. This statement will be more readily understood when we
 have considered what energy is.</p>

 <p>Energy, like matter, is indestructible, and just as matter exists in
 various forms so does energy. And we may add, just as we are ignorant of what
 the negative and positive particles of electricity which constitute matter
 really are, so we are ignorant of the true nature of energy. At the same
 time, energy is not so completely mysterious as it once was. It is another of
 nature&#39;s mysteries which the advance of modern science has in some
 measure unveiled. It was only during the nineteenth century that energy came
 to be known as something as distinct and permanent as matter itself.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">Forms of Energy</h4>

 <p>The existence of various forms of energy had been known, of course, for
 ages; there was the energy of a falling stone, the energy produced by burning
 wood or coal or any other substance, but the essential <i>identity</i> of all
 these forms of energy had not been suspected. The conception of energy as
 something which, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id=
 "Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> matter, was constant in amount, which could
 not be created nor destroyed, was one of the great scientific acquisitions of
 the past century.</p>

 <p>It is not possible to enter deeply into this subject here. It is
 sufficient if we briefly outline its salient aspects. Energy is recognised in
 two forms, kinetic and potential. The form of energy which is most apparent
 to us is the <i>energy of motion</i>; for example, a rolling stone, running
 water, a falling body, and so on. We call the energy of motion <i>kinetic
 energy</i>. Potential energy is the energy a body has in virtue of its
 position&mdash;it is its capacity, in other words, to acquire kinetic energy,
 as in the case of a stone resting on the edge of a cliff.</p>

 <p>Energy may assume different forms; one kind of energy may be converted
 directly or indirectly into some other form. The energy of burning coal, for
 example, is converted into heat, and from heat energy we have mechanical
 energy, such as that manifested by the steam-engine. In this way we can
 transfer energy from one body to another. There is the energy of the great
 waterfalls of Niagara, for instance, which are used to supply the energy of
 huge electric power stations.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">What Heat is</h4>

 <p>An important fact about energy is, that all energy <i>tends to take the
 form of heat energy</i>. The impact of a falling stone generates heat; a
 waterfall is hotter at the bottom than at the top&mdash;the falling particles
 of water, on striking the ground, generate heat; and most chemical changes
 are attended by heat changes. Energy may remain latent indefinitely in a lump
 of wood, but in combustion it is liberated, and we have heat as a result. The
 atom of radium or of any other radio-active substance, as it disintegrates,
 generates heat. &quot;Every hour radium generates sufficient heat to raise
 the temperature of its own weight of water, from the freezing point to the
 boiling point.&quot; And what is heat? <i>Heat is molecular motion.</i> The
 molecules of every substance, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id=
 "Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> we have seen on a previous page, are in a
 state of continual motion, and the more vigorous the motion the hotter the
 body. As wood or coal burns, the invisible molecules of these substances are
 violently agitated, and give rise to ether waves which our senses interpret
 as light and heat. In this constant movement of the molecules, then, we have
 a manifestation of the energy of motion and of heat.</p>

 <p>That energy which disappears in one form reappears in another has been
 found to be universally true. It was Joule who, by churning water, first
 showed that a measurable quantity of mechanical energy could be transformed
 into a measurable quantity of heat energy. By causing an apparatus to stir
 water vigorously, that apparatus being driven by falling weights or a
 rotating flywheel or by any other mechanical means, the water became heated.
 A certain amount of mechanical energy had been used up and a certain amount
 of heat had appeared. The relation between these two things was found to be
 invariable. Every physical change in nature involves a transformation of
 energy, but the total quantity of energy in the universe remains unaltered.
 This is the great doctrine of the Conservation of Energy.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 13</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Substitutes for Coal</h4>

 <p>Consider the source of nearly all the energy which is used in modern
 civilisation&mdash;coal. The great forests of the Carboniferous epoch now
 exists as beds of coal. By the burning of coal&mdash;a chemical
 transformation&mdash;the heat energy is produced on which at present our
 whole civilisation depends. Whence is the energy locked up in the coal
 derived? From the sun. For millions of years the energy of the sun&#39;s rays
 had gone to form the vast vegetation of the Carboniferous era and had been
 transformed, by various subtle processes, into the potential energy that
 slumbers in those immense fossilized forests.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

 <p>The exhaustion of our coal deposits would mean, so far as our knowledge
 extends at present, the end of the world&#39;s civilisation. There are other
 known sources of energy, it is true. There is the energy of falling water;
 the great falls of Niagara are used to supply the energy of huge electric
 power stations. Perhaps, also, something could be done to utilise the energy
 of the tides&mdash;another instance of the energy of moving water. And
 attempts have been made to utilise directly the energy of the sun&#39;s rays.
 But all these sources of energy are small compared with the energy of coal. A
 suggestion was made at a recent British Association meeting that deep borings
 might be sunk in order to utilise the internal heat of the earth, but this is
 not, perhaps, a very practical proposal. By far the most effective
 substitutes for coal would be found in the interior energy of the atom, a
 source of energy which, as we have seen, is practically illimitable. If the
 immense electrical energy in the interior of the atom can ever be liberated
 and controlled, then our steadily decreasing coal supply will no longer be
 the bugbear it now is to all thoughtful men.</p>

 <p>The stored-up energy of the great coal-fields can be used up, but we
 cannot replace it or create fresh supplies. As we have seen, energy cannot be
 destroyed, but it can become <i>unavailable</i>. Let us consider what this
 important fact means.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 14</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Dissipation of Energy</h4>

 <p>Energy may become dissipated. Where does it go? since if it is
 indestructible it must still exist. It is easier to ask the question than to
 give a final answer, and it is not possible in this <span class=
 "smcap">Outline</span>, where an advanced knowledge of physics is not assumed
 on the part of the reader, to go fully into the somewhat difficult theories
 put forward by physicists and chemists. We may raise the temperature, say, of
 iron, until it is white-hot. If we stop the process the temperature of the
 iron will gradually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg
 286]</a></span> settle down to the temperature of surrounding bodies. As it
 does so, where does its previous energy go? In some measure it may pass to
 other bodies in contact with the piece of iron, but ultimately the heat
 becomes radiated away in space where we cannot follow it. It has been added
 to the vast reservoir of <i>unavailable</i> heat energy of uniform
 temperature. It is sufficient here to say that if all bodies had a uniform
 temperature we should experience no such thing as heat, because heat only
 travels from one body to another, having the effect of cooling the one and
 warming the other. In time the two bodies acquire the same temperature. The
 sum-total of the heat in any body is measured in terms of the kinetic energy
 of its moving molecules.</p>

 <p>There must come a time, so far as we can see at present, when, even if all
 the heat energy of the universe is not radiated away into empty infinite
 space, yet a uniform temperature will prevail. If one body is hotter than
 another it radiates heat to that body until both are at the same temperature.
 Each body may still possess a considerable quantity of heat energy, which it
 has absorbed, but that energy, so far as reactions between those two bodies
 are concerned, <i>is now unavailable</i>. The same principle applies whatever
 number of bodies we consider. Before heat energy can be utilised we must have
 bodies with different temperature. If the whole universe were at some uniform
 temperature, then, although it might possess an enormous amount of heat
 energy, this energy would be unavailable.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">What a Uniform Temperature would mean</h4>

 <p>And what does this imply? It implies a great deal: for if all the energy
 in the world became unavailable, the universe, as it now is, would cease to
 be. It is possible that, by the constant interchange of heat radiations, the
 whole universe is tending to some uniform temperature, in which case,
 although all molecular motion would not have ceased, it would have become
 unavailable. In this sense it may be said that the universe is running
 down.</p>

 <p>If all the molecules of a substance were brought to a standstill, that
 substance would be at the absolute zero of temperature. There could be
 nothing colder. The temperature at which all molecular motions would cease is
 known: it is -273° C. No body could possibly attain a lower temperature than
 this: a lower temperature could not exist. Unless there exists in nature some
 process, of which we know nothing at present, whereby energy is renewed, our
 solar system must one day sink to this absolute zero of temperature. The sun,
 the earth, and every other body in the universe is steadily radiating heat,
 and this radiation cannot go on for ever, because heat continually tends to
 diffuse and to equalise temperatures.</p>

 <p>But we can see, theoretically, that there is a way of evading this law. If
 the chaotic molecular motions which constitute heat could be
 <i>regulated</i>, then the heat energy of a body could be utilised directly.
 Some authorities think that some of the processes which go on in the living
 body do not involve any waste energy, that the chemical energy of food is
 transformed directly into work without any of it being dissipated as useless
 heat energy. It may be, therefore, that man will finally discover some way of
 escape from the natural law that, while energy cannot be destroyed, it has a
 tendency to become unavailable.</p>

 <p>The primary reservoir of energy is the atom; it is the energy of the atom,
 the atom of elements in the sun, the stars, the earth, from which nature
 draws for all her supply of energy. Shall we ever discover how we can
 replenish the dwindling resources of energy, or find out how we can call into

  by Professor Soddy.</p>
 </div>

 <p>It is certain that energy is an actual entity just as much as matter, and
 that it cannot be created or destroyed. Matter and ether are receptacles or
 vehicles of energy. As we have said, what these entities really are in
 themselves we do not know. It may be that all forms of energy are in some
 fundamental way aspects of the same primary entity which constitutes matter:
 how all matter is constituted of particles of electricity we have already
 seen. The question to which we await an answer is: What is electricity?</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 15</h3>

 <h3>MATTER, ETHER, AND EINSTEIN</h3>

 <p>The supreme synthesis, the crown of all this progressive conquest of
 nature, would be to discover that the particles of positive and negative
 electricity, which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of
 disturbances of some kind in a universal ether, and that all our
 &quot;energies&quot; (light, magnetism, gravitation, etc.) are waves or
 strains of some kind set up in the ether by these clusters of electrons.</p>

 <p>It is a fascinating, tantalising dream. Larmor suggested in 1900 that the
 electron is a tiny whirlpool, or &quot;vortex,&quot; in ether; and, as such a
 vortex may turn in either of two opposite ways, we seem to see a possibility
 of explaining positive and negative electricity. But the difficulties have
 proved very serious, and the nature of the electron is unknown. A recent view
 is that it is &quot;a ring of negative electricity rotating about its axis at
 a high speed,&quot; though that does not carry us very far. The unit of
 positive electricity is even less known. We must be content to
 know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg
 289]</a></span> the general lines on which thought is moving toward the final
 unification.</p>

 <p>We say &quot;unification,&quot; but it would be a grave error to think
 that ether is the only possible basis for such unity, or to make it an
 essential part of one&#39;s philosophy of the universe. Ether was never more
 than an imagined entity to which we ascribed the most extraordinary
 properties, and which seemed then to promise considerable aid. It was
 conceived as an elastic solid of very great density, stretching from end to
 end of the universe, transmitting waves from star to star at the rate of
 186,000 miles a second; yet it was believed that the most solid matter passed
 through it as if it did not exist.</p>

 <p>Some years ago a delicate experiment was tried for the purpose of
 detecting the ether. Since the earth, in travelling round the sun, must move
 through the ether if the ether exists, there ought to be a stream of ether
 flowing through every laboratory; just as the motion of a ship through a
 still atmosphere will make &quot;a wind.&quot; In 1887 Michelson and Morley
 tried to detect this. Theoretically, a ray of light in the direction of the
 stream ought to travel at a different rate from a ray of light against the
 stream or across it. They found no difference, and scores of other
 experiments have failed. This does not prove that there is no ether, as there
 is reason to suppose that our instruments would appear to shrink in precisely
 the same proportion as the alteration of the light; but the fact remains that
 we have no proof of the existence of ether. J. H. Jeans says that
 &quot;nature acts as if no such thing existed.&quot; Even the phenomena of
 light and magnetism, he says, do not imply ether; and he thinks that the
 hypothesis may be abandoned. The primary reason, of course, for giving up the
 notion of the ether is that, as Einstein has shown, there is no way of
 detecting its existence. If there is an ether, then, since the earth is
 moving through it, there should be some way of detecting this motion. The
 experiment has been tried, as we have said, but, although the method used was
 very sensitive, no motion was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id=
 "Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> discovered. It is Einstein who, by
 revolutionising our conceptions of space and time, showed that no such motion
 ever could be discovered, whatever means were employed, and that the usual
 notion of the ether must be abandoned. We shall explain this theory more
 fully in a later section.</p>

 <h3>INFLUENCE OF THE TIDES: ORIGIN OF THE MOON: THE EARTH SLOWING DOWN</h3>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 16</h3>

 <p>Until comparatively recent times, until, in fact, the full dawn of modern
 science, the tides ranked amongst the greatest of nature&#39;s mysteries.
 And, indeed, what agency could be invoked to explain this mysteriously
 regular flux and reflux of the waters of the ocean? It is not surprising that
 that steady, rhythmical rise and fall suggested to some imaginative minds the
 breathing of a mighty animal. And even when man first became aware of the
 fact that this regular movement was somehow associated with the moon, was he
 much nearer an explanation? What bond could exist between the movements of
 that distant world and the diurnal variation of the waters of the earth? It
 is reported that an ancient astronomer, despairing of ever resolving the
 mystery, drowned himself in the sea.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Earth Pulled by the Moon</h4>

 <p>But it was part of the merit of Newton&#39;s mighty theory of gravitation
 that it furnished an explanation even of this age-old mystery. We can see, in
 broad outlines at any rate, that the theory of universal attraction can be
 applied to this case. For the moon, Newton taught us, pulls every particle of
 matter throughout the earth. If we imagine that part of the earth&#39;s
 surface which comprises the Pacific Ocean, for instance, to be turned towards
 the moon, we see that the moon&#39;s pull, <i>acting on the loose and mobile
 water</i>, would tend to heap it up into a sort<span class='pagenum'><a name=
 "Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> of mound. The whole earth is
 pulled by the moon, but the water is more free to obey this pull than is the
 solid earth, although small tides are also caused in the earth&#39;s solid
 crust. It can be shown also that a corresponding hump would tend to be
 produced on the other side of the earth, owing, in this case, to the tendency
 of the water, being more loosely connected, to lag behind the solid earth. If
 the earth&#39;s surface were entirely fluid the rotation of the earth would
 give the impression that these two humps were continually travelling round
 the world, once every day. At any given part of the earth&#39;s surface,
 therefore, there would be two humps daily, i.e. two periods of high water.
 Such is the simplest possible outline of the gravitational theory of the
 tides.</p>

   the loose and mobile water is more free to obey this pull than is the solid

   conditions. The wall-like formation of these tidal waves (see next page
   also) will be noticed. The reason for this is that the downward current in
   the river heads the sea-water back, and thus helps to exaggerate the
   advancing slope of the wave. The exceptional spring tides are caused by the
   combined operation of the moon and the sun, as is explained in the

 <p>The actually observed phenomena are vastly more complicated, and the
 complete theory bears very little resemblance to the simple form we have just
 outlined. Everyone who lives in the neighbourhood of a port knows, for
 instance, that high water seldom coincides with the time when the moon
 crosses the meridian. It may be several hours early or late. High water at
 London Bridge, for instance, occurs about one and a half hours after the moon
 has passed the meridian, while at Dublin high water occurs about one and a
 half hours before the moon crosses the meridian. The actually observed
 phenomena, then, are far from simple; they have, nevertheless, been very
 completely worked out, and the times of high water for every port in the
 world can now be prophesied for a considerable time ahead.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Action of Sun and Moon</h4>

 <p>It would be beyond our scope to attempt to explain the complete theory,
 but we may mention one obvious factor which must be taken into account. Since
 the moon, by its gravitational attraction, produces tides, we should expect
 that the sun, whose gravitational attraction is so much stronger, should also
 produce tides and, we would suppose at first sight, more powerful tides than
 the moon. But while it is true that the sun produces tides, it is<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> not true that
 they are more powerful than those produced by the moon. The sun&#39;s
 tide-producing power is, as a matter of fact, less than half that of the
 moon. The reason of this is that <i>distance</i> plays an enormous rôle in
 the production of tides. The mass of the sun is 26,000,000 times that of the
 moon; on the other hand it is 386 times as far off as the moon. This greater
 distance more than counterbalances its greater mass, and the result, as we
 have said, is that the moon is more than twice as powerful. Sometimes the sun
 and moon act together, and we have what are called spring tides; sometimes
 they act against one another, and we have neap tides. These effects are
 further complicated by a number of other factors, and the tides, at various
 places, vary enormously. Thus at St. Helena the sea rises and falls about
 three feet, whereas in the Bay of Fundy it rises and falls more than fifty
 feet. But here, again, the reasons are complicated.</p>

 <h3 class="dim">§ 17</h3>

 <h4 class="sect">Origin of the Moon</h4>

 <p>But there is another aspect of the tides which is of vastly greater
 interest and importance than the theory we have just been discussing. In the
 hands of Sir George H. Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, the tides had been
 made to throw light on the evolution of our solar system. In particular, they
 have illustrated the origin and development of the system formed by our earth
 and moon. It is quite certain that, long ages ago, the earth was rotating
 immensely faster than it is now, and that the moon was so near as to be
 actually in contact with the earth. In that remote age the moon was just on
 the point of separating from the earth, of being thrown off by the earth.
 Earth and moon were once one body, but the high rate of rotation caused this
 body to split up into two pieces; one piece became the earth we now know, and
 the other became the moon. Such is the conclusion to which we are led by an
 examination of the tides. In the first place let us consider the energy
 produced by the tides. We see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id=
 "Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> evidences of this energy all round the
 word&#39;s coastlines. Estuaries are scooped out, great rocks are gradually
 reduced to rubble, innumerable tons of matter are continually being set in
 movement. Whence is this energy derived? Energy, like matter, cannot be
 created from nothing; what, then, is the source which makes this colossal
 expenditure possible.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Earth Slowing down</h4>

 <p>The answer is simple, but startling. <i>The source of tidal energy is the
 rotation of the earth.</i> The massive bulk of the earth, turning every
 twenty-four hours on its axis, is like a gigantic flywheel. In virtue of its
 rotation it possesses an enormous store of energy. But even the heaviest and
 swiftest flywheel, if it is doing work, or even if it is only working against
 the friction of its bearings, cannot dispense energy for ever. It must,
 gradually, slow down. There is no escape from this reasoning. It is the
 rotation of the earth which supplies the energy of the tides, and, as a
 consequence, the tides must be slowing down the earth. The tides act as a
 kind of brake on the earth&#39;s rotation. These masses of water, <i>held
 back by the moon</i>, exert a kind of dragging effect on the rotating earth.
 Doubtless this effect, measured by our ordinary standards, is very small; it
 is, however, continuous, and in the course of the millions of years dealt
 with in astronomy, this small but constant effect may produce very
 considerable results.</p>

 <p>But there is another effect which can be shown to be a necessary
 mathematical consequence of tidal action. It is the moon&#39;s action on the
 earth which produces the tides, but they also react on the moon. The tides
 are slowing down the earth, and they are also driving the moon farther and
 farther away. This result, strange as it may seem, does not permit of doubt,
 for it is the result of an indubitable dynamical principle, which cannot be
 made clear without a mathematical discussion. Some interesting consequences
 follow.</p>

 <p>Since the earth is slowing down, it follows that it was once<span class=
 'pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> rotating
 faster. There was a period, a long time ago, when the day comprised only
 twenty hours. Going farther back still we come to a day of ten hours, until,
 inconceivable ages ago, the earth must have been rotating on its axis in a
 period of from three to four hours.</p>

 <p>At this point let us stop and inquire what was happening to the moon. We
 have seen that at present the moon is getting farther and farther away. It
 follows, therefore, that when the day was shorter the moon was nearer. As we
 go farther back in time we find the moon nearer and nearer to an earth
 rotating faster and faster. When we reach the period we have already
 mentioned, the period when the earth completed a revolution in three or four
 hours, we find that the moon was so near as to be almost grazing the earth.
 This fact is very remarkable. Everybody knows that there is a <i>critical
 velocity</i> for a rotating flywheel, a velocity beyond which the flywheel
 would fly into pieces because the centrifugal force developed is so great as
 to overcome the cohesion of the molecules of the flywheel. We have already
 likened our earth to a flywheel, and we have traced its history back to the
 point where it was rotating with immense velocity. We have also seen that, at
 that moment, the moon was barely separated from the earth. The conclusion is
 irresistible. In an age more remote the earth <i>did</i> fly in pieces, and
 one of those pieces is the moon. Such, in brief outline, is the tidal theory
 of the origin of the earth-moon system.</p>

 <h4 class="sect">The Day Becoming Longer</h4>

 <p>At the beginning, when the moon split off from the earth, it obviously
 must have shared the earth&#39;s rotation. It flew round the earth in the
 same time that the earth rotated, that is to say, the month and the day were
 of equal length. As the moon began to get farther from the earth, the month,
 because the moon took longer to rotate round the earth, began to get
 correspondingly longer. The day also became longer, because the earth was
 slowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg
 295]</a></span> down, taking longer to rotate on its axis, but the month
 increased at a greater rate than the day. Presently the month became equal to
 two days, then to three, and so on. It has been calculated that this process
 went on until there were twenty-nine days in the month. After that the number
 of days in the month began to decrease until it reached its present value or
 magnitude, and will continue to decrease until once more the month and the
 day are equal. In that age the earth will be rotating very slowly. The
 braking action of the tides will cause the earth always to keep the same face
 to the moon; it will rotate on its axis in the same time that the moon turns
 round the earth. If nothing but the earth and moon were involved this state
 of affairs would be final. But there is also the effect of the solar tides to
 be considered. The moon makes the day equal to the month, but the sun has a
 tendency, by still further slowing down the earth&#39;s rotation on its axis,
 to make the day equal to the year. It would do this, of course, by making the
 earth take as long to turn on its axis as to go round the sun. It cannot
 succeed in this, owing to the action of the moon, but it can succeed in
 making the day rather longer than the month.</p>

 <p>Surprising as it may seem, we already have an illustration of this
 possibility in the satellites of Mars. The Martian day is about one half-hour
 longer than ours, but when the two minute satellites of Mars were discovered
 it was noticed that the inner one of the two revolved round Mars in about
 seven hours forty minutes. In one Martian day, therefore, one of the moons of
 Mars makes more than three complete revolutions round that planet, so that,
 to an inhabitant of Mars, there would be more than three months in a day.</p>

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
